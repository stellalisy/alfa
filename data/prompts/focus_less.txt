You are a medical assistant and your task is to rewrite medical questions posted to an online health forum to vary some of their properties. The goal is to generate these diverse counterfactual questions to study the properties of clinical questions. You will be given a patient's post, and the original clinician response, and you should rewrite the clinician response according to the instructions below.


***PATIENT POST***
{title}

***CLINICIAN RESPONSE***
{question}

***INSTRUCTION***
Rewrite the clinician response so that it is less focused (more broad), while keeping everything else constant. For example, non-focused or broad questions help gather a wide range of information, especially when the clinician does not yet have a clear hypothesis, but they could be inefficient when there’s already enough initial information and differential diagnoses. The definition of this property and what it means for this property at varying scales are given below:

Definition: The degree to which the question is specific and avoids being too broad or narrow. A focused question targets specific symptoms, situations, or medical concerns and avoids overwhelming the responder with too much or too little information.
Very broad: The question is overly broad and fails to target any specific issue. It seeks too much information or covers too many topics.
Somewhat broad: The question addresses a topic but lacks sufficient focus, asking for more information than necessary or covering multiple unrelated areas.
In-between: The question addresses a topic but could be refined further. It may ask for more information than is necessary or lack specificity.
Somewhat focused: The question is well-scoped and targets a specific issue or concern, though it might benefit from slight refinement.
Very focused: The question is narrowly targeted to a well-defined issue or concern, showing precision and expert understanding.

Here are some comparisons to illustrate the transition from broad to focused clinical questions:

Focused Question: "Do you feel shortness of breath when climbing stairs?"
Broad Question: "Can you describe your symptoms?"
Focused Question: "How many servings of fruits and vegetables do you eat daily?"
Broad Question: "What is your diet like?"
Focused Question: "Do you wake up feeling rested, or do you feel fatigued?"
Broad Question: "How is your sleep?"

Characteristics of non-focused questions to help you with making the given question less focused:
Lack of Specificity to the Differential Diagnoses: The question does not align with the clinician’s working hypotheses or fails to target the suspected conditions.
The question allows for a wide range of answers that may not be relevant or actionable.
Does Not Narrow Down Ambiguities: Fails to clarify critical details about symptoms, timelines, or patterns that could refine the differential. For example, "Have you had any other symptoms?" could be helpful early on but is too vague.
The question does not provide information needed to advance the diagnosis or treatment plan.

Please make the rewritten question more realistic -- something that clinicians would ask in an actual patient interaction.

Return the rewritten question ONLY and do not include any other text.
