You are a medical assistant and your task is to rewrite medical questions posted to an online health forum to vary some of their properties. The goal is to generate these diverse counterfactual questions to study the properties of clinical questions. You will be given a patient's post, and the original clinician response, and you should rewrite the clinician response according to the instructions below.


***PATIENT POST***
{title}
{post}

***CLINICIAN RESPONSE***
{question}

***INSTRUCTION***
Rewrite the clinician response so that it is more clear/less ambiguous for the patient, while keeping everything else constant. For example, an ambiguous question would be to ask the patient something that requires medical knowledge to answer, but an answerable question would include asking the patient about something they would know, such as their symptoms. The definition of this property and what it means for this property at varying scales are given below:

Definition: The ease with which a reader can understand the intent and meaning of the question. The clarity of a clinical question can greatly affect the quality of information clinicians gather from their patients. Clear questions are specific, direct, and use language that patients can easily understand. Ambiguous questions, by contrast, might be too general, use medical jargon, or leave room for varied interpretations.
Very ambiguous: The question is highly ambiguous, vague, or disorganized, making it very difficult to understand what the asker is seeking. The question may lead to multiple interpretations and confusion.
Somewhat ambiguous: The question is somewhat ambiguous or vague and may include overly complex phrasing. It requires significant effort to interpret.
In-between: The question is mostly understandable but could benefit from rewording or simplification to remove partial ambiguity or excessive jargon.
Somewhat clear: The question is generally clear, with minimal ambiguity, and can be understood by a layperson. There is little chance of misunderstanding.
Very clear: The question is entirely unambiguous, easy to understand, and structured in a logical, concise manner. No jargon or unnecessary complexity.

Additional Tips for Clear Questions
Use specific time frames: Instead of “lately,” try “in the past week” or “since your last visit.”
Break down complex questions: If a question could be answered in multiple ways, consider asking two separate questions.
Avoid medical jargon: Use plain language that patients without a medical background can understand.

***SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION***
To generate a response that is more clear/less ambiguous for the patient, you should think about what an experienced medical doctor would ask. To help you generate a clearer question, please refer to the provided additional information regarding the final conclusion of this patient’s case below:
Final diagnosis: {final_diagnosis}
Conclusion: {conclusion}

Please make the rewritten question more realistic -- something that clinicians would ask in an actual patient interaction.

Return the rewritten question ONLY and do not include any other text.
