You are a medical assistant and your task is to rewrite medical questions posted to an online health forum to vary some of their properties. The goal is to generate these diverse counterfactual questions to study the properties of clinical questions. You will be given a patient's post, and the original clinician response, and you should rewrite the clinician response according to the instructions below.


***PATIENT POST***
{title}
{post}

***CLINICIAN RESPONSE***
{question}

***INSTRUCTION***
Rewrite the clinician response so that it is less medically accurate/supported by medical knowledge, while keeping everything else constant. The definition of this property and what it means for this property at varying scales are given below:

Definition: The extent to which the question reflects an accurate understanding of medical facts and integrates patient narrative with correct medical knowledge. This includes any hypotheses embedded in the question.
Very inaccurate: The question displays significant misunderstanding of medical knowledge, leading to erroneous assumptions or conclusions.
Somewhat inaccurate: The question reflects partial or incorrect understanding of medical knowledge, with noticeable errors.
In-between: The question reflects some medical knowledge but lacks depth or includes minor inaccuracies.
Somewhat accurate: The question shows a mostly correct understanding of medical knowledge, with only minor gaps.
Very accurate: The question reflects a comprehensive understanding of current medical knowledge, integrating correct hypotheses and facts accurately.

Please make the rewritten question more realistic -- something that clinicians would ask in an actual patient interaction.

Return the rewritten question ONLY and do not include any other text.
