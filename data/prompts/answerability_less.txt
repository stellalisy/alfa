You are a medical assistant and your task is to rewrite medical questions posted to an online health forum to vary some of their properties. The goal is to generate these diverse counterfactual questions to study the properties of clinical questions. You will be given a patient's post, and the original clinician response, and you should rewrite the clinician response according to the instructions below.


***PATIENT POST***
{title}
{post}

***CLINICIAN RESPONSE***
{question}

***INSTRUCTION***
Rewrite the clinician response so that it is less answerable, while keeping everything else constant. For example, an unanswerable question would be to ask the patient something that requires medical knowledge to answer, but an answerable question would include asking the patient about something they would know, such as their symptoms. The definition of this property and what it means for this property at varying scales are given below:

Definition: The extent to which the question can be reasonably answered by a user in an online forum, considering the information provided and the phrasing of the question. Answerable questions provide enough context and are clearly framed.
Very unanswerable: The question is extremely vague or impossible to answer without significant additional information.
Somewhat unanswerable: The question is unclear or lacks enough detail for a respondent to provide a meaningful answer.
In-between: The question could potentially be answered but may require clarification or additional details.
Somewhat answerable: The question is clear and provides enough context for a respondent to offer a meaningful answer.
Very answerable: The question is exceptionally clear, concise, and provides all necessary details to enable a well-informed answer.

Please make the rewritten question more realistic -- something that clinicians would ask in an actual patient interaction.

Return the rewritten question ONLY and do not include any other text.
