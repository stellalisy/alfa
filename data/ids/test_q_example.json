    "post": "Thank you in advance for any help with this!\n\nOkay, so my boyfriend came home last week sick with diarrhea, nausea, cramps, fever, aches, and chills. We chalked it up to the stomach flu. However, now I have yellow diarrhea (he said he did, too), stomach cramps, and extreme fatigue. We both have not been able to eat much (yesterday I had a small bowl of pudding and half a sandwich). I have not had fever, chills, or aches. However, this has been going on for about 5 days now and I'm not exactly sure if what we got was actually Gastroenteritis.  \n\nAny advice would be wonderful. If this doesn't go away by Wednesday I need to see a Dr., but I'd like to know how to treat it now.",
