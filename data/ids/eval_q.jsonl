I know we'll find out soon enough, but in the meantime, could you please suggest alternative diagnoses that aren't so scary, so I can think positively? \n\nHe is 50 years old, fit as an ox (bike commutes daily), eats healthy, has taken a multivitamin and a baby aspirin daily for decades, is on no other meds, and is in otherwise excellent health -- except for chronic, unexplained anemia. He has had the anemia for at least a decade.  About 5 years ago, his GP sent him for endoscopy to rule out internal bleeding. Then she put him on a course of B12 injections, that did nothing. However a few months later, his anemia then improved enough that there was no further follow up and he was okay. This year he went back for a routine check up and his anemia is back, and worse than ever. He had another endoscopy and a colonscopy. His GI tract is normal, no gluten intolerance, nothing. His B12 and folate is also normal, and his GP no longer thinks it's related to diet/B12 deficiency. She has referred him to a hematologist. She has run a ton of blood tests, everything is normal, except for his hemoglobin, which is below normal. She is also concerned with his low total blood count. His WBC and platelets are within normal range - but at the very end of low. \n\nSymptoms - he has all the symptoms of anemia you'd expect. Extreme fatigue, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells, sometimes short of breath, pallor, etc. He has a long history of unexplained, massive bruising (like, covering both his thighs, or his mid-torso). This comes and goes and he's never had a blood test or seen his GP during a bruising episode, but he has reported this to his doctor. On and off history of bleeding gums. And this week he admitted to me that his long bones ache. \n\nHe showed me his blood tests so I did see the scores,  but he then took the paperwork away from me and filed them at work. I have asked for a copy and he won't give me one,  because he knows I am prone to worry too much. He tends to worry too, and I know he is much more worried than he is letting on to me. \n\n", "title": "Ease my worries please", "author_post": "temp4askdocs", "id_post": "1nug27", "post_author_feedback": true, "pos_post_author_feedback": 1.0, "turn_count": 7, "total_score": 8, "verified_author_flairs": ["Physician"], "unique_author_counts": 2, "year": 2013, "created_utc": 1381073288, "has_conclusion": 1, "refer_to_hospital": 0.0, "prev_additional_contexts": [{"question": "Would be helpful with the exact values of the CBC.

{"thread_id": "t_ctua454-0", "post": "**Medical history:** I am a white, 20 (almost 21) year old female, and I'm 5' 5\" and 130 lbs.  (Edit:  I forgot to mention that I am in the US.)  I am on the birth control Levora, and have been for 12.5 months (I took the generic for 12 months and just started a new cycle of the brand name because that is what they had for me).  I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder about 2 years ago, but I have treated it with therapy and I feel (as does my therapist) that I have made great progress.  I don't drink alcohol regularly (and always in small amounts) and I have never done any drugs whatsoever.  Also, I am definitely *not* pregnant.  \n\n**Abbreviated symptoms:** \n\n* Extreme nausea in the morning, exacerbated by the hour at which I get up.  5am is worse than 7am, etc, and if I wake up naturally, the problem is basically nonexistent.\n* I don't know if it's connected, but for the past month-ish, I have had soft, yellow stool on and off.  Nothing particularly awful about the movements, I just thought the color was interesting.\n* I also don't know if this is connected, but liquid seems to go right through me.  It's been this way for a long time...probably a few years.  The first time I experienced it was 5ish years ago.  I drink what should be a normal amount of liquid, and I find myself having to pee 3 times in the span of 30 minutes (with a full bladder each time).\n* Last random symptom, my sex drive has completely disappeared in the past 4 months.  I love my boyfriend dearly, and he's super sexy and amazing in bed...I just have 0 interest (and before that, I used to want it at least once every other day, if not more).\n\n**Long version of the nausea problem:**\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I've always been a little nauseous in the mornings.  I used to have terrible allergies and I would throw up phlegm every morning.  My allergies have since gotten much better, but I am finding that it is harder and harder to wake up early and not get sick.\n\nFor the past 3 months, I have been in a routine of getting up at 6 for work, eating breakfast at 6:30, lunch at noon, dinner at 5, (no after dinner snacks) and going to bed between 9:30 and 10:30.  On a weekend, when I wake up later (and sometimes naturally as opposed to with an alarm), I feel alright.  Still nauseous enough that I gag when I brush my back teeth, but I don't feel like I'm in danger of throwing up.  A few weeks ago, I had to get up at 5 for a trip, and I was *so* close to throwing up for between 2 and 3 hours after I got up.  This past week, it has gotten worse, to the point that I considered letting myself throw up, just so I hopefully wouldn't feel so sick (and I haven't changed my schedule even slightly in the past 3 months).\n\n**Morning eating habits:**\n\nFor breakfast before work (and before that 5am trip - I am a creature of habit), I have half a store-bought muffin, and a small 8ish ounce glass of milk.  I do my best to force it down without throwing up, and so far I have been successful.  If I don't eat, the whole thing gets much worse, but sometimes I am so nauseous that I nearly throw up just getting my milk out of the fridge.  I want to emphasize that after about an hour (or more the longer I have been awake), I am no longer nauseous, and I feel fine.  I also always eat breakfast.  I feel very very sick if I wait too long to eat breakfast (using waking up naturally as a control group, since if I get up early, I always feel very very sick).\n\n**Other tidbits of information:**\n\nCurrently I am on break from university, so I'm not sure how long the symptoms would be this severe, if I had this schedule all the time, but it still happens at school when I have to get up early to be somewhere, even with a change of schedule.  This is really impacting my life, and making me anxious about getting up at 5am in a few days to go back to school.\n\nI am happy to answer any questions that you guys have that might help you figure out what's going on with me.

When I was about 19, I was diagnosed with idiopathic angioedema, triggered by an allergic reaction to IV dye. This is something I have been dealing with for nearly a decade.\n  When I have flair ups, my whole body is affected. I have symptoms that match those of anaphylaxis. (hives that cover the entire body, swelling of the mouth- inside and out, throat swelling and hoarse voice, redness in the skin, hands swell up like baseball mitts). I am not currently taking medication for this, but I keep an epipen and benadryl on hand for emergencies.\nWhat I find abnormal about this is that since then, I have these symptoms to food, specifically meat. (my trigger) I found the worst to be turkey and beef, and I recently had to go to the hospital via ambulance for eating a chicken nugget. No one that I have ever met that has angioedema has a problem with meat. I have never had a flair up because of stress or anxiety or heat or cold or anything else that usually causes flair ups for other people with this condition. Another thing that I find odd is that sometimes coming into contact with these things will cause a rash and minor swelling in my hands or face.If someone were to cook beef in close proximity, I swell up.\nIs it possible that I am simply just allergic to these things, or do I have a really weird version of angioedema? Could it be something else going on?\n\nFor the past decade, eating has been very stressful for me, as well as confusing. I just want to take the right steps and making sure I stay safe and know what exactly is going on.\n\nI was tested to see if I was allergic to turkey via blood test and the test came up positive.

It is absolutely genetic; my youngest brother has migraines too, and my mother's side of the family is afflicted on her father's side.\n\n\n**Her symptoms are:**\n\n* Originating in the back of the head (usually left side)\n* Often radiates to one eye (usually right eye)\n* Sensitive scalp (sometimes must untie hair for relief)\n* Has had tingling in her fingertips and elbow before (details below)\n* Many crackling sounds in her neck (it seemed important to her)\n\n\n**New symptoms are:**\n\n- Neck has been hurting (&lt;1week) (Pain of 8,9, and 10 this past Saturday, 1-10 rating with 10 being worst)\n- Now affecting her sleeping posture and hours, where before it wasn't.\n- \"It feels like something is pulling on my brain.\" (Points to left occipital lobe) **&lt;-------Please comment on this at least!**\n- Frequency and severity of migraines has increased lately, very noticeably.\n\n\n**Noteworthy:**\n\n- The tingling has subsided for now, correlating with a change in medicine.\n- Because of the crackling, she has done 'neck exercises' each day for the past few years.\n- She does not have restricted mobility of her neck. It is just in pain. She cannot describe it further.\n\n\n**Medicine and Tests:**\n\n- Sleep test: Negative (we strongly thought it would be)\n- Nerve test: Negative\n- MRI in 2002: Negative\n- Nortriptyline: Antidepressant to lower BP, a preventative medicine. Recently upped from 75mg--&gt;100mg.\n- Assorted vitamins: regularly\n- Prescribed painkillers: as needed\n\n\n**About my mom:**\nShe is the sweetest, most selfless person I know. She doesn't want to try acupuncture because it isn't covered by our insurance. She has a high pain tolerance, and would rather finish her work shift while powering through a migraine than complain to anyone. She just quietly takes her medicine and keeps going. When she comes home, if it's really bad, she will go to her room. It'll be dead quiet and blacked-out the lights to help her sleep the pain off. I can already tell that I will have to keep asking her about setting up a doctor's appointment this week, but I'll keep on it.\n\n\n[I have my suspicions,](/s \"that it is a pinched nerve,\") **(Hover over the link to view)** but want to hear what you think. Mom is almost too embarrassed to ask for a second opinion or bring up fancy medical terms like 'occipital lobe'. Granted, I was using Google to look up her symptoms tonight which is probably a medical no-no, but I learned that it's possible she got a false negative on the nerve test and that something could have been overlooked on the MRI.\n\n\nThe medicine that lowered her blood pressure actually caused tingling in her feet (she was given a few different varieties of BP lowering meds...) so she spoke with the doctor to decrease them several months ago and the tingling has since left. The neurologist really tried to convince my mom last time that her sleeping posture is contributing to the tingling and migraines, which we both agreed tonight is bullshit. Yes, he's a professional, but this does not correlate with her experience as a young child having migraines. Also, mom explicitly told me that the pain and morning stiffness of her neck does not feel anything like when you sleep wrong on a your neck. Plus, she uses a very flat pillow or forgoes it altogether. So we feel like the current neurologist is grasping at straws here, and that over the past decade+ she has not seen her symptoms or migraines get better but rather worse.\n\n\nDoes my suspicion sound correct? Do you have any ideas of your own? What can I say to the next doctor/specialist she sees so I don't sound clueless but still emphasize that she needs greater medical attention (which she downplays herself)?\n\n**EDIT** *Thank you to everyone who replied!!!

I still have migraines now, but they are nothing compared to what I dealt with for years.  I saw quite a few doctors, including multiple neurologists and a migraine specialist, and took way more drugs than I ever wanted trying to find something that would stop them.  Nothing had an impact of any sort on them, and if she's found pain meds that actually touch the migraines, she's one of the lucky ones.  \nSo, what has helped?  A series of events that led to the primary cause, I believe.  I never had my wisdom teeth pulled because they were not impacted nor causing problems, and we didn't have the money for unnecessary procedures.  A couple of years ago, I had had a constant migraine for 2 years (honestly, never ending, only increasing/decreasing in severity), and my wisdom teeth starting bothering me, primarily on the left side.  I decided I just couldn't take any more contributing pain and went to the surgeon. He said the right side teeth were too in-grown into my sinuses and jaw to remove, but he could remove the left.  The pain after surgery was horrible! I had the worst migraine ever for 3 solid days ... and then it was almost gone!  I held my breath for the increase to come again, and it never did!  At the same time, however, I had terrible pain in my jaw and couldn't open it.  It turns out that I have TMJ disorder that had not been diagnosed previously (not from the surgery, but he would have done it differently had he known about it prior).  \nI started researching TMJ and realized how much it fit me.  It had been dismissed years before because I don't grind my teeth.  I do, however, clench, which causes a lot of jaw and neck pain, lots of cracking in the neck, ringing in the ears, and MIGRAINES as well as other symptoms I was experiencing.  I now treat the TMJ and experience only one every couple of weeks on average.  I still get some that are unexplained by my TMJ, but I can definitely live with them.  \nMy advice as someone who is just like her ... look into the TMJ and see if it fits.  For me, it really clicked and I figured trying the \"at home\" things to see if it would help couldn't make it worst at that point.  It had more of a positive impact that any med I'd been given, and I knew I was on the right track.  I truly hope she finds the same or something else that clicks for her.

It is absolutely genetic; my youngest brother has migraines too, and my mother's side of the family is afflicted on her father's side.\n\n\n**Her symptoms are:**\n\n* Originating in the back of the head (usually left side)\n* Often radiates to one eye (usually right eye)\n* Sensitive scalp (sometimes must untie hair for relief)\n* Has had tingling in her fingertips and elbow before (details below)\n* Many crackling sounds in her neck (it seemed important to her)\n\n\n**New symptoms are:**\n\n- Neck has been hurting (&lt;1week) (Pain of 8,9, and 10 this past Saturday, 1-10 rating with 10 being worst)\n- Now affecting her sleeping posture and hours, where before it wasn't.\n- \"It feels like something is pulling on my brain.\" (Points to left occipital lobe) **&lt;-------Please comment on this at least!**\n- Frequency and severity of migraines has increased lately, very noticeably.\n\n\n**Noteworthy:**\n\n- The tingling has subsided for now, correlating with a change in medicine.\n- Because of the crackling, she has done 'neck exercises' each day for the past few years.\n- She does not have restricted mobility of her neck. It is just in pain. She cannot describe it further.\n\n\n**Medicine and Tests:**\n\n- Sleep test: Negative (we strongly thought it would be)\n- Nerve test: Negative\n- MRI in 2002: Negative\n- Nortriptyline: Antidepressant to lower BP, a preventative medicine. Recently upped from 75mg--&gt;100mg.\n- Assorted vitamins: regularly\n- Prescribed painkillers: as needed\n\n\n**About my mom:**\nShe is the sweetest, most selfless person I know. She doesn't want to try acupuncture because it isn't covered by our insurance. She has a high pain tolerance, and would rather finish her work shift while powering through a migraine than complain to anyone. She just quietly takes her medicine and keeps going. When she comes home, if it's really bad, she will go to her room. It'll be dead quiet and blacked-out the lights to help her sleep the pain off. I can already tell that I will have to keep asking her about setting up a doctor's appointment this week, but I'll keep on it.\n\n\n[I have my suspicions,](/s \"that it is a pinched nerve,\") **(Hover over the link to view)** but want to hear what you think. Mom is almost too embarrassed to ask for a second opinion or bring up fancy medical terms like 'occipital lobe'. Granted, I was using Google to look up her symptoms tonight which is probably a medical no-no, but I learned that it's possible she got a false negative on the nerve test and that something could have been overlooked on the MRI.\n\n\nThe medicine that lowered her blood pressure actually caused tingling in her feet (she was given a few different varieties of BP lowering meds...) so she spoke with the doctor to decrease them several months ago and the tingling has since left. The neurologist really tried to convince my mom last time that her sleeping posture is contributing to the tingling and migraines, which we both agreed tonight is bullshit. Yes, he's a professional, but this does not correlate with her experience as a young child having migraines. Also, mom explicitly told me that the pain and morning stiffness of her neck does not feel anything like when you sleep wrong on a your neck. Plus, she uses a very flat pillow or forgoes it altogether. So we feel like the current neurologist is grasping at straws here, and that over the past decade+ she has not seen her symptoms or migraines get better but rather worse.\n\n\nDoes my suspicion sound correct? Do you have any ideas of your own? What can I say to the next doctor/specialist she sees so I don't sound clueless but still emphasize that she needs greater medical attention (which she downplays herself)?\n\n**EDIT** *Thank you to everyone who replied!!! It's midnight right now, but I will do a lot of reading tomorrow, and let my mom know that she has support online. Also, the link goes nowhere. If you hover over the link, a textbox appears with my 'suspicion'. I didn't know how to format a black censor box, but if I find out tomorrow, I will change that. :)*", "title": "My loving mother is suffering from migraines, and I'd like your opinion.", "author_post": "EccentricSatellite", "id_post": "3pg8ba", "post_author_feedback": true, "pos_post_author_feedback": 1.0, "turn_count": 2, "total_score": 4, "verified_author_flairs": ["Registered Nurse"], "unique_author_counts": 2, "year": 2015, "created_utc": 1445315298, "has_conclusion": 1, "refer_to_hospital": 0.0, "prev_additional_contexts": [], "comment_id": "cwd19ce", "comment_author": "ragel1214", "comment_body": "A pinched nerve is definitely a possibility especially with the neck pain, but it's unrelated to migraines, and there are more symptoms I would expect to see that you haven't listed (radiating pain down one arm, pain being worse in one position and better in another).

{"thread_id": "t_cy1tsx8-0", "post": "20 year old male, 5'10\", probably around 115 (fast metabolism), white. No drugs, but I am a smoker.\n\nSo, my brother hit me on the head several times on Monday. He also pulled my hair, and hit me near the face and on the left ear. Obviously, that's an issue in or of itself, but it's not my actual issue.\n\nOn Monday, I felt mostly fine, and just had a headache. My ear, face, and kidney also hurt, but the pain lasted for a very short time (I was pressed up against a seat in a car). I went to work on that day in the evening, and didn't feel like I had a problem, besides being tired.\n\nOn Tuesday, I didn't seem to have a headache (unless it were so minor, that I immediately forgot). However, after picking up my sister in the morning, I began to feel dizzy, and somewhat disoriented. At about 2 or 3, I began to walk, move, and talk very slowly. I was also slurring my words. I called off work that day and rested. In addition, I went to urgent care, but since my symptoms were no longer present, and also appeared neurologically fine, I was diagnosed with a headache, and sent home.\n\nToday, Wednesday, I went to my second job for my first day. I was fine then, aside from a small headache every now and then. Afterwords, I went to my second job feeling perfectly fine. However, at 6-6:30 PM, about an hour and a half after starting, I began to feel nauseous, and also weird in my throat. I can't really describe that last part well, it was like I felt sick in my throat as well, and also had a little bit of trouble swallowing. I began to move and talk very slowly. The boss let me off, and I trudged slowly to the vehicle. I attempted to drive, and found I was mostly okay aside from sluggishness. It just plain seemed difficult to get my body to respond quickly. By the time I got home, I was stuttering and talking very slowly. It felt as if I could barely get the necessary words out. It felt also as if my body would not easily respond to my brain. My mind seemed mostly okay, although I noticed that little voice in my head also stuttered. This lasted about 2 to 2 and a half hours, and went away, just like Tuesday. \n\nMy parents think I'm either faking, having a psychosomatic reaction, or responding to a virus that's been going around. I don't think I'm faking or having a psychosomatic reaction, because I'm really annoyed. I've also become annoyed at my parents, perhaps unreasonably so. Honestly, I don't like cutting work because I can't move or speak, and I need my job. I want to figure out whether I need to actually see a specialist, and whether or not I should be working.\n\nThank you for taking the time to respond to this post. One more thing I'll add, is that at the end of writing this, I've noticed that the talking and moving symptoms are behaving like spells. I'm perfectly fine one minute, the next, I'm having trouble typing this and talking. Is this normal?\n\nEdit: I think it might be muscle spasticity. I have felt like my muscles are locking and tightening up, making it difficult to move and speak. My muscles are also getting tired.", "title": "Brother hit me several times on the head.

I don't want to suggest anything that will make things worse, so what I'll say is you may want to research the following ideas. Cimetidine is an otc h2 inhibitor that also inhibits a long list of cyt p450's (I recall reading awhile back mast cell might have something to do with p450's?) Studies have been done on higher doses of cimetidine for all kinds of nerve damage, inflammation and even cancer. It must be cimetidine and not one of the similar meds. Another idea would be topical applications. Epsom salt baths or applying Epsom salt cream or lotion. Heat and warm baths tend to assist circulation and might reduce the inflammation. You may need to research going old school...very old school, and trying poultices that were used prior to the invention of nsaids and modern treatments that your body is rejecting. Years ago when I was traveling and was in a village without access to a 24 hr CVS, I was advised to apply a poultice of fresh rosemary leaves and grain mustard to might hugely swollen knee. The swelling went down and after 3 applications I was able to walk and bear weight on it again. You may need to get creative and research what our great-grandparents would have done in your condition or what people might still be doing in other corners of the world. Have you considered acupuncture? Or consulting a Chinese Medicine practitioner? Sauna? You may find you have to reach outside the box and outside of your regular comfort zone.\n\n&gt;Hives, feeling like my throat is closing\n\nIs your throat actually closing or swelling shut or does it just feel as if it is? If it feels as if it is, the route to go may be meditation training, learning self calming techniques or biofeedback. Once when I was in the hospital I thought my throat was closing off and I felt as if I couldn't breath. But a nurse was there and she pointed out that my oxygen levels hadn't dropped and she could see that I was obviously breathing...the episode ended.\n\nThere's one other thing I can think of for you to investigate, it's called Palmitoylethanalamide, also known as PEA. It is already in our bodies so perhaps yours won't develop an allergy to it.\n\nGood luck", "comment_is_question": true, "comment_is_response": false, "comment_respond_to": null, "comment_requested_info": "opinions/ideas on treating inflammation for someone allergic to meds", "comment_question_type": "Lifestyle questions", "comment_is_personal_experience": false, "comment_is_medical_knowledge": false, "comment_is_answered": true, "comment_is_relevant": true, "comment_score": 2, "comment_parent_id": "t3_5b3f9w", "comment_turn_level": 0, "comment_author_flair_text": "This user has not yet been verified.", "comment_created_utc": 1478288273, "qid": "t_d9lxq1k-0-c0-q0", "question": "Is your throat actually closing or swelling shut or does it just feel as if it is?", "patient_answer": "Just to clarify; my throat does close and epi is needed.

{"thread_id": "t_d9yf5du-0", "post": "Hello,\n\nMy wife and I are on vacation on the island of Saint Maarten. She has an allergy to ibuprofen, which we have figured out through many trials in the past. This allergy was developed while she was an adult. Anyways, yesterday morning she accidentally took some cold medicine twice with 200mg ibuprofen per dose. She now has hives all over her legs and arms, some on her chest back and face. She is incredible itchy. Initially she was having slight issues with a fever but that seems to have subsided. \n\nAbout 3 years ago my wife was hospitalized for weeks on end at brigham and womens in boston because she had a chronic fever of 104+ with a purple rash covering her body. This was a result of an ibuprofen allergy. The entire time she was in the hospital the reaction was being compounded by the fact that they kept giving her more ibuprofen to try to combat her fever. This ended up putting her in near kidney failure and turning purple from vasculitis. They ended up putting her on massive doses of prednisone via IV and orally in order to calm the inflamation. This was the only thing that helped get her better.

Anyways, yesterday morning she accidentally took some cold medicine twice with 200mg ibuprofen per dose. She now has hives all over her legs and arms, some on her chest back and face. She is incredible itchy. Initially she was having slight issues with a fever but that seems to have subsided. \n\nAbout 3 years ago my wife was hospitalized for weeks on end at brigham and womens in boston because she had a chronic fever of 104+ with a purple rash covering her body. This was a result of an ibuprofen allergy. The entire time she was in the hospital the reaction was being compounded by the fact that they kept giving her more ibuprofen to try to combat her fever. This ended up putting her in near kidney failure and turning purple from vasculitis. They ended up putting her on massive doses of prednisone via IV and orally in order to calm the inflamation.

I just wanted some advice as to what this might be beforehand because urgent care didn't give me a super convincing answer. also this is really long oops.\n\nI'm white, female, a junior in high school, and weigh about 150lbs (not super relevant to this I think oops). I have the nexplanon birth control implant and have had it for about a month. I am on no other medications aside from the pain meds I was given today and a b12 vitamin I take every day since I'm deficient. I also have high cholestoral but these have happened long before that was discovered.\n\nso a few times I year for a very long time I've gotten these odd dizzy spells. I get nauseous but not in the pukey kinda way, it's more like \"overall feeling *wrong* and kinda don't know which way is up\" nausea. I get spotty vision and my balance is a bit weird along with my arms and legs shaking a little, but usually this whole episode passes after about 10-15 minutes and as it normally happens during school time I can maintain my composure and don't look visibly ill. I don't usually get a headache from these.\n\nexcept for today. I ate more breakfast than usual (usually I only have time for a smoothie but I had bacon and eggs too today) which hasn't really ever affected me. I didn't eat lunch since I don't have anything I can easily pack, but I'm not ever hungry at lunchtime because at this point in the year my internal clock is \"\"trained\"\" to get hungry around the time I get home from school anyway since I never bring lunch. other than that my schedule and life is exactly the same as it's been since the school year started, down to me drinking the same amount of water I normally do every day.\n\nabout an hour before the episode happened I started getting really really hot for a few minutes, than really really cold and I was getting real sweaty. I was having a good time in class and didn't really think about it since my schools ac is wonky. I left that class and went to Spanish, and that's when I got that weird creeping nausea where you just overall feel *bad*.\n\nin my Spanish class there are no chairs. we stand in a circle for a while at the beginning, and when we start doing the assignment we sit on the floor. today we were going over vocabulary words and we each had to make up an action for a few, so we were standing for a very long time. I made sure my knees weren't locked but at this point my vision was getting really bright and I felt a little \"far away\" mentally if that makes sense. over the course of about 5 minutes:\n\n- I got so many spots in my eyes and every color I could see was so bright I was lowkey blind\n\n- I was super hyperaware of my legs. was almost physically unable to stop bending them and shifting my weight.\n\n- I got this awful ringing in my ears and couldn't hear pretty much anything\n\n- I was actively trying to not faint, but at the same time felt like I would faint weather I wanted to or not.\n\n- my head felt like, for lack of a better phrase, not mine\n\n- my weird vision and weird head feeling made me keep touching my face. I have terrible high schooler pores and should not have done this.\n\n- my hands were shaking so bad when I autopiloted through my actions for the vocab words the teacher noticed how freakishly pale I'd gotten and how terrible I am at fake comer-ing and asked if yo estoy bien. yo no estoy bien. \n\nI ambled down to the health center at my school after somehow stammering in horrid Spanish that I needed to leave. the receptionist told me there was no nurse in today and a few minutes later someone else appeared and asked if I'd eaten that day and then vanished.\n\nI sat down for a little bit and felt better, but my limbs still felt weak and my head was starting to hurt a little bit. normally I don't get headaches and this episode was a lot more severe than the other ones.\n\n I called my mom and she took me to urgent care, and the doctor, who, after hearing all the things I've told you, said his best guess is that it was an \"extremely atypical migraine\" and prescribed some pain medication.  if it's super atypical, wouldn't it be too different from a migraine to be considered one? still, the pain meds made me not have to wear sunglasses indoors due to the light sensitivity (also not normal after the episodes) so whatever.

The center of my neck right by my hairline is painful and tender to the touch, as are the sides of my neck right where the skull meets the neck below the ears. I've experienced intermittent episodes of jaw pain, dizziness, nausea, tight traps, heachaches, blurred vision, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty concentrating. I don't have a fever or any general fatigue.\n\nI went to urgent care and they did X-rays which were negative other than the physician said my spine was stiff and straight, which he said is indicative of inflammed neck muscles. I was prescribed Flexeril and naproxen 500. I'm still having trouble sleeping on my neck and doing most activities because I never know when I'll move my neck slightly wrong and get dizzy.\n\nMy biggest fear is I slipped or herniated a disc and it's pressing on my spinal cord, but it's a huge ordeal to get an MRI.

HBeAB positive, HBeAG negative.\n\nAugust2017: ALT/AST normal, DNA viral load undectectable/HBeAB positive, HBeAG negative, HBsAG negative, HBsAB negative. Acording to my doctor, everything was fine except no HBsAB and ALP 130IU/L(slightly high?)\n\nI am scheduled for another test next month(ultrasound/liver function test/HBsAG Quantitative).\n\nBut right now am i considered as chronically infected with Hepatitis B? and for HBsAG Quantitative test next month what kind of results should i be expecting for my case?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated!!", "title": "Am i considered chronically infected from Hepatitis B?", "author_post": "needsomehelp_90", "id_post": "7g5p9b", "post_author_feedback": false, "pos_post_author_feedback": 1.0, "turn_count": 11, "total_score": 14, "verified_author_flairs": ["B.S., Medical Lab Sciences"], "unique_author_counts": 2, "year": 2017, "created_utc": 1511889538, "has_conclusion": 1, "refer_to_hospital": 0.0, "prev_additional_contexts": [], "comment_id": "dqgxcse", "comment_author": "Pinky135", "comment_body": "Once you have been infected with Hep B, you keep the virus in your body. In people with healthy immune systems the virus will stay inactive, but when the immune system starts to fail (due to, for instance, immunosuppressant drugs or cancer treatment), the virus can re-activate and cause liver disease.\n\nNow, on to your tests. First, what do the abbreviations mean? HBe and HBs are antigens of the hep B virus. AG means antigen, AB means antibody. Antibodies are produced by white blood cells against antigens. \n\nHBs is the first antigen type that is detectable in blood tests, and is the antigen present on the surface of Hep B virus particles. HBe is the second antigen type that is detectable in blood tests and the more this antigen is in the blood, the more actively the virus is replicating. Both are used as an indicator of how far the infection is. The surface antigen (HBsAG) is detectable for a very long time in patients with chronic infection, as well as the e-antigen (HBeAG). \n\n May 2017: HBeAB (antibodies against hep B-e antigen) is positive, so your immune system has produced antibodies against that specific antigen. HBeAG (or the e-antigen of Hep B), was negative. This means the reproduction of virus particles has ceased.\n\nAugust 2017: HBeAB is still positive, so the antibodies are still present in your blood. HBeAG is still negative, so the virus is still not replicating. HBsAB and HBsAG are both negative. This means the virus is not present in your blood anymore, and you do not have antibodies against the HBs antigen.\n\nThe test results are a bit confusing, because if you did clear the virus, your results would show negative HBsAG, but positive HBsAB. Another test to get done is a test for the core-antigen of Hep B and the antibody against it, also known as HBcAG and HBcAB. If the antibody is still detected, then you're all healed up and the immune system is getting rid of the old antibodies it hasn't used in quite some time.

{"thread_id": "t_drhsbkk-0", "post": "Hey guys. Im kind of at wits end here. Im almost at the bottom here, and I don't know where to turn anymore. This might be a long post, so apologies if so, but I just want to get it all out there, and get an opinion. I'll just list little paragraphs with each thing;\n\nSo im a 29 year old male living in eastern Canada. I've been dealing with symptoms for a few years now. I'm very underweight (I'm 5'7, and 110lbs). It's gotten bad enough that people at work at always commenting on how sickly and skinny I look. People are getting worried. I looked at myself in the mirror last night, and you can see some ribs, and at my pelvis, you can see some bones jutting out too. My appetite is pretty low, but I eat enough to not be THIS skinny. I've gone on weight gain diets before, but I end up feeling ill from eating too much, and giving up because I'm never seeing results. I'll gain some weight, and I'll literally lose it overnight. Sometimes I can go the entire day without eating, only getting hungry later at night. If I have a day off, I usually eat a small breakfast, maybe a small lunch, a normal dinner, and then a large snack later at night.\n\nI'm also dealing with depression and anxiety. It's affecting my motivation. Because of this, I have very little energy, not enough to even go to a doctor and do something. I sometimes don't want to get out of bed. My anxiety comes and goes, but in general, theres always a little background tension. I haven't felt 'comfortable' in years. I haven't felt happy in years. I'm seeing a psychologist, but I'm afraid I might have to be put on medication very soon. I've also self-diagnosed myself with agoraphobia and some OCD (I know self-diagnosis isn't smart, but Im almost 100% certain that I have both).\n\nI'm always cold. I don't like being in the cold. I get body chills sometimes. When I'm in a cold environment, I just want out asap. \n\nMy libido is very low. No desire. I haven't had a partner in a while. If I do, I always have a hard time reaching orgasm. The only thing which helps this is cannabis, but unfortunately, sometimes the cannabis can bring up my anxiety which is not good (I'm currently recovering my a really bad episode). \n\nIm diagnosed hypothyroid. I've done my blood work recently, and it's come back normal. I'm on synthroid which I take every day.\n\nI have general apathy. I don't care about anything. Music has lost it's appeal. So has all my hobbies. My relationships are failing. My work life is very difficult because of all this. \n\nI'm in such a negative space. Life has lost its appeal. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I plan on seeing a psychiatrist and going on an anti-depressant, but that thought scares me. I'm not sure if all the other ailments which are affecting me all go back to this mental health stuff. I feel like I've seen doctors, and once they find out about my thyroid/anxiety/depression, they automatically say it's part of that without looking more into it. I feel like something else might be going on, but I haven't found anyone willing to help me discover what the problem is. I need help.", "title": "29yo male. Very underweight. Depressed. Cold.

But, I do know what depression feels like. I am on medication for it, and it truly is a life saver. I think going to see a psychiatrist is the best thing you can do. They can literally treat your brain. If you haven't been to one before, it will be mostly all talking in their office...no gown/exam table ( at least in my experience). They will ask you questions and decide what meds or combo of meds seem right to start with. Some drugs take a couple of weeks to kick in, and then you'll notice you are feeling different in a good way. Can you say why this thought scares you? To me, it's more scary to NOT go to a psychiatrist and be treated. My MD prescribed meds for me, and maybe 3 weeks later saw me again and tweaked the dosage. I've been great for 3 years now and I will never go off them for fear of feeling like I did without them. I haven't experienced any side effects but if I did, my MD could find a different drug for me. I can hear the desperation in your post, and I just want you to know that you are not alone and feeling better IS possible. You will feel immense relief. Talk therapy with a psychologist is also usually part of treatment, and it can be life changing as well. One of my issues was I was constantly thinking really bad thoughts about myself, telling myself I was a piece of shit, etc. She taught me how to stop that. It made such a difference as I didn't even realize I was doing that to myself.  I started feeling much better about myself and more accepting of myself as I am. I hope that you will give going to the psychiatrist a try. I really believe it will help you because some of the things you said are classic symptoms of depression. There is definitely the chance of enjoying your life again.  I'm rooting for you!\n\nEdit: oops I see you already are seeing a psychologist.

{"thread_id": "t_ecx8etq-0", "post": "33/F/White. \n\nNo medications, diagnosed Anxiety / Agoraphobia. \n\nFamily history of AFib, Copd\n\n\nI've been to clinics twice but keep getting dismissed as having anxiety. I've had anxiety for most of my life and I'm pretty good at managing and recognizing it. This is not that. \n\n\nI noticed some symptoms about a year ago,  but it has increased in severity over the last 2 months. \n\n\nOther notable problem, my house is mouldy and I sleep in the basement. I didn't have any of these issues before moving here. I keep the windows open and an air filter on, which does help slightly. When I stay elsewhere, I do feel much better. It's not an option to do that too frequently. \n\n\nIn the mornings, which is the most amount of time I spend inside, my lungs feel cramped. They burn, my throat burns. I feel lightheaded. \n\n\nToday, I went for a walk around my block. I've been trying to do this lately as the last time I left my neighbourhood I had to hurry back because I felt like I was going to faint. (Things I've never been anxious about before)\n\n\nToday, I make it two blocks downhill. I can't get a full breath. My hands and legs feel tingly, I feel jittery and dizzy. I crossed the street to catch a bus back home and my heart was racing. Cars going past made me very dizzy. The bus came but I couldn't get on it because it was too bright and my heart wouldn't slow down. I ended up walking back, feeling for sure I was going to faint but tried to breathe deeply to push through it. I kept yawning. It normally takes me 10 mins to walk the two blocks. Today it took and hour and a half to walk down and come back. \n\n\nWhat can I do? What tests might I need to take? I know my anxiety is going to kick in now and I'll be very nervous to try this again, but I have to figure out what's happening and get a solution to this.

I've had anxiety for most of my life and I'm pretty good at managing and recognizing it. This is not that. \n\n\nI noticed some symptoms about a year ago,  but it has increased in severity over the last 2 months. \n\n\nOther notable problem, my house is mouldy and I sleep in the basement. I didn't have any of these issues before moving here. I keep the windows open and an air filter on, which does help slightly. When I stay elsewhere, I do feel much better. It's not an option to do that too frequently. \n\n\nIn the mornings, which is the most amount of time I spend inside, my lungs feel cramped. They burn, my throat burns. I feel lightheaded. \n\n\nToday, I went for a walk around my block. I've been trying to do this lately as the last time I left my neighbourhood I had to hurry back because I felt like I was going to faint. (Things I've never been anxious about before)\n\n\nToday, I make it two blocks downhill. I can't get a full breath. My hands and legs feel tingly, I feel jittery and dizzy. I crossed the street to catch a bus back home and my heart was racing. Cars going past made me very dizzy. The bus came but I couldn't get on it because it was too bright and my heart wouldn't slow down. I ended up walking back, feeling for sure I was going to faint but tried to breathe deeply to push through it. I kept yawning. It normally takes me 10 mins to walk the two blocks. Today it took and hour and a half to walk down and come back. \n\n\nWhat can I do? What tests might I need to take? I know my anxiety is going to kick in now and I'll be very nervous to try this again, but I have to figure out what's happening and get a solution to this. I'm not sure how I'll get to the clinic if I can't get beyond a few blocks from my house. \n\n\nEdit to add: I've been losing weight as well. I don't know how much as I don't have a scale.

{"thread_id": "t_f9pcfd2-0", "post": "39F, been trying to get this figured out for months now:\n\nI'm experiencing several symptoms that are slowly getting worse and could use some insight:\n\n* **inability to tolerate all but the gentlest exercise**. During the workout I'm ok but shortly thereafter I get inordinately sore and my muscles burn instead of building. I can't seem to build any muscle mass any more. (I used to be a competitive distance runner and lifted weights regularly, so I know what \"normal\" sore is supposed to feel like. This isn't that). This soreness lingers for days afterwards. I also find that if I work my upper body very much (like rowing for two minutes), I experience a mild weakness/drop in grip strength in both hands for a few hours afterwards and feel \"shaky\" raising something as small as a drinking glass to my mouth.\n* **Speech disturbance, especially when stressed**: I'll be talking and my tongue briefly (like 1 sec.) spasms against my upper palate at the same time that my jaw seems to \"seize\" a little. Happens maybe once a day, max. People listening to me have commented on this so I know I'm not overexaggerating.\n* **Histamine(?) reaction during cardio:** This hasn't happened as often lately, but when I run for anything over about 8 minutes, I experience a sudden flare in itchiness from the waist down and have to stop before it goes away. It's exceedingly unpleasant and feels kind of like the \"normal\" itch I always used to experience at the start of a workout as my capillaries got increased blood flow (especially when running downhill), but ten times more severe. If I look at my legs while this is happening they have a spiderwebby red look like I've seen in some bee-sting reactions. I know this isn't from clothing or laundry detergent, as it's happened in clothes of a huge variety of looseness, fabrics, fits, etc.\n* **Overall itchiness**\\-- this is not on the surface of my skin like psoriasis or eczema but rather *in* my skin. It's not localized to one spot but seems to move all around my body. It will be a little point of itch in one spot, I scratch it, it disappears from that location and then like 2 seconds later appears elsewhere. I don't think it's psychosomatic because it happens in my sleep too. My boyfriend says I scratch periodically in my sleep. Some days it's worse and some days it's better.\n* **Pronounced sciatica** on just one side of my pelvis; the SI joint became massively inflamed while I was fighting a GI illness about 6 months ago and hasn't gotten much relief since then.\n\nWhat could this be?", "title": "39F, muscle weakness, wasting &amp; soreness, itching, loss of coordination, speech disturbance", "author_post": "ThanksIMadeItMyself", "id_post": "e6d51h", "post_author_feedback": false, "pos_post_author_feedback": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "total_score": 2, "verified_author_flairs": [], "unique_author_counts": 2, "year": 2019, "created_utc": 1575526713, "has_conclusion": 0, "refer_to_hospital": 0.0, "prev_additional_contexts": [], "comment_id": "f9pcfd2", "comment_author": "Interesting_Number", "comment_body": "INFO: what is your weight and what is your diet like?", "comment_is_question": true, "comment_is_response": false, "comment_respond_to": null, "comment_requested_info": "weight and diet", "comment_question_type": "Screening questions", "comment_is_personal_experience": false, "comment_is_medical_knowledge": false, "comment_is_answered": null, "comment_is_relevant": true, "comment_score": 1, "comment_parent_id": "t3_e6d51h", "comment_turn_level": 0, "comment_author_flair_text": "This user has not yet been verified.", "comment_created_utc": 1575529464, "qid": "t_f9pcfd2-0-c0-q0", "question": "What is your weight and what is your diet like?", "patient_answer": "See my reply inline.", "question_type": "Checklist", "binary_question": false, "hypotheses": [], "additional_context": "I forgot to mention my weight and dietary habits.

{"thread_id": "t_fbbmbxf-0", "post": "Hi! A few months ago I noticed that I had a runny nose that was very clear, salty, and waterry, definitely not mucus, just a watery, slightly slipperry substance. About 6 weeks ago, I woke up with chills, and had what seemed like a bout of the flu for over a week.   \n\n\nBecause the symptoms didn't stop in time, I went to the ER, where they discovered via X-Ray that I did not have pneumonia. I made an appointment with m y primary care and nothing else was found. The primary care physician suggested allergy medication. I tried Zyrtec regularly, and had no improvement.   \n\n\nThis draining fluid is so bad that at night if I'm in the same position for too long on the wrong side, my pillow gets soaked in that spot. The coughing is worst at night, and minimal during the day. I'm a bit lower energy than I used to be, also.

If it is still present by the time she is &gt;6 months, they will likely try and coil it, instead of surgery.  That is basically just going in through the groin and placing this little coil that has special fibers on it and the body just naturally grows scar tissue around it and closes the PDA.  The PFO they don't *always* close.  Again it will depend on whether she is having any symptoms.  \n\nIf they can't do a coil, they will do it as a trans-thoracic surgery which is done by cutting a small incision in the side of the chest and then using instruments to place what looks a little like a staple on the PDA to close it.  \n\nIt is incredibly rare for them to do an open heart surgery.  \n\nAs heart surgeries go, it is basically as low-risk as you can get.  They have lots and lots and lots of practice closing PDAs, on babies far smaller than she is.  They used to surgically close PDAs in preemies shortly after birth, but it caused problems because they were not mature enough to handle the hemodynamic changes and their blood vessels in their brains are immature at that point.  \n\nAt her age, her blood vessels are nice and mature, her brain is much better at keep circulation and blood pressure in the brain constant, no matter what else is happening, and it is incredibly well-tolerated in my experience.  \n\nDepending on which procedure they do, they may just keep her for 1-2 days or a many as 5, if there are no major complications, which would be very unusual to have. \n\nAny time you do surgery, it has risks, but this is a surgery that is frequently performed and has very good outcomes if it is not done on a 24 week infant in the first week of life  LOL  \n\nContinue following with cardiology, and you can discuss with them about who is going to be the cardiothoracic surgeon for her case and ask how many times they do this procedure in a year, which way are they going to do it, why did they choose that method, does the PFO need to be closed or can it be allowed to stay etc.  If you think the CT surgeon in the area doesn't do enough of them for you to be comfortable, you can always ask to be referred to a larger center. \n\nThis goes without saying hopefully, but it should only be done by peds teams, not cardiologists/cardiothoracic surgeons who take care of adults primarily.  \n\nThe PFO might not need to close (because the shunting that is keeping it open might go away once the PDA is closed so it could close naturally, and PFOs are almost never hemodynamically significant in otherwise healthy people.

It is currently stuck inside of him and a portion hanging out of his urethra. They then did a procedure to help the kidney drain and inserted a catheter. They then told him he could go home and to come back every 3 days to see if the tool would naturally be released.\nWe refused to have him leave the hospital and return to a ranch environment due to risk of infection. \nI tried to do an internet search and could not find any similar cases. Does the advice of the surgeon make sense? It just does not seem right.\nAny advice or help on this matter would be greatly appreciated. We are also in process of trying to get a second opinion.\n\nUpdate: It has been a week to the day since the initial procedure. The tool has been stuck in him this whole time. This morning my father noticed that it seemed to have moved a little bit, so he started pulling on it. He managed to get 7-8 inches of it out by himself before the pain became unbearable. He then notified the surgeon and nurses. The surgeon rushed over and he was administered extra pain killers from what he had been on. As they were giving him the painkillers the surgeon was also seeing if the tool would slide out further. He was able to pull it out the rest of the way. My dad is ecstatic! However, he has torn ureter, which was caused by the initial procedure.

{"thread_id": "t_f9iro7y-0", "post": "22F living in Canada (also, white), approx 5'10\" and 205lbs.\n\nI've been experiencing a number of symptoms that are getting more alarming, and the list keeps getting longer... I've had to leave work early twice this week. I'm in the midst of getting medical care, waiting on test results, more testing and next steps. I'm just hoping someone might have an idea, as the doctor I'm seeing currently doesn't have any. I'll try to give as much information as possible.\n\nMedications: Ortho Tri-Cyclen, NOT low, for the past year.Recreational use of marijuana, frequently, as I use it for anxiety/stress relief.No alcohol consumption, no cigarettes/tobacco.\n\nPrevious Medical Conditions: I have generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD and bipolar disorder, but they have been well under control. Some chronic pain with no definitive diagnosis, but nothing like this. In 2017(?), I was told by a cardiologist that I most likely have a mild form of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). I have had 2 UTIs and 1 or 2 yeast infections in the past year. I have had a number of these symptoms before, but not as bad as they've become.\n\nSymptoms:\n\n* Frequent nausea. Pretty much every day now, but began probably 6-8 weeks ago on a 3x a week basis. Time of day changes, with or without eating, sometimes wakes me up at night.\n* Vomiting. The past three days I've vomited at least once a day. Before that, it was happening occasionally along with the nausea for the last 6-8 weeks. Yesterday morning, I woke up around 5am to throw up and it had brown bits even though I hadn't eaten in almost 12 hours? I usually feel a little better after I throw up.\n* Fatigue. I am so so so tired, all the time. I can sleep for more than 10 hours and still be yawning and feel like taking a nap 4 hours after I wake up. I just want to be in bed as much as possible. It's not oversleeping either though, because shorter sleep times have the same results.\n* Lower back pain. Moderate pain in my lower back every single day for over a month, and sometimes I would rate the pain even higher as perhaps a 7/10.\n* Abdominal pains. More recently, in the last 3 or so weeks I've been having abdominal pains daily, mostly towards the top of my abdomen but sometimes nearer my pelvis as well. Slight tenderness to touch, and warmth to touch.\n* Loss of appetite. I usually have a very good appetite, but lately I find myself struggling to eat more often than not and regretting what I do eat as it ends in more pain and discomfort, and never seems to sit right.\n* Daily headaches. Usually front of the head, more often in the afternoon than other times. I work in an office setting, so I was attributing it to the computer screen.\n* Slightly elevated body temp. Not actual fever or anything, but hitting 99.6-99.9F in the past week.\n* Flushing rash on face. It's not constant, it comes and goes, but my face gets red and flushed, and very warm. I can feel it burning just as it is, and feels hot when touched with a hand.\n* Change to menstrual cycle. I take hormonal birth control pills, and it is usually pretty regular withdrawal bleedings, but last month I had a couple days of spotting early and then no period. It's now 14 days late.\n* Diarrhoea, kind of? I have to go usually 3 or more times per day, but not super soft and sometimes I'm actually constipated.\n* Difficulty concentrating, like it's physically difficult, I can't wrap my head around my work.\n* Lightheadedness (which makes it difficult to concentrate)\n* Frequent urination, but this has been for most of my life. Wake up at night to go usually.\n* Slight shortness of breath, particularly when going up stairs, etc, and more than usual for myself.\n* Trouble swallowing? Not constantly, but a few times, felt like lump in throat.\n\nOriginally when I went to the doctor, I was just nausea/vomiting/heartburn, so I had a 2 week trial of Rabeprazole 20MG. It did help a little with the acid reflux issue, but it did not fully stop the issues and now they have progressed even further.\n\nSo far, I've had blood testing done. The results I've gotten are, and I've put the reference ranges in brackets:\n\nCBC - all within range\n\nVitamin B12 - 199 (138-652)Ferritin - 43 (5-272)Random glucose - 4.8 (3.6-7.7)HAC1 - 5.3 (&lt;6.0)Sodium - 140 (135-145)Potassium - 4.4 (3.5-5.2)Chloride - 103 (98-108)Creatinine - 85 (50-100)Glomerular Filtration Rate - 84 (says between 60 and 89 is consistent with mildly decreased kidney function)Urate - 273 (150-390)Alanine Aminotransferase 11 (&lt;36)Creatine Kinase - 60 (33-165)TSH - 3.38 (0.32-4.00)HCG - &lt;1 (&lt;5 = negative)\n\nI am still waiting to be scheduled for an abdominal ultrasound. Any insights into what this could be would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance.  \n\n\n(Edited the above to add a few details I forgot)\n\nUpdate: I returned to the doctor to discuss the results of my ultrasound, as well as to let him know about the 15lbs I've lost since late October and that I have noticed some blood/mucous in my stool recently.\n\nThe ultrasound has come back with no concerns based on the images.\n\nI am being referred to a gastroenterologist, and will likely have the appointment sometime late January-ish.\n\nI don't seem to be getting the heartburn as bad lately, but the abdominal pains are getting worse, and I am definitely losing my appetite even more. The pains I get are mostly an almost burning pain around the upper middle part of my abdomen, right above the belly button, and then also in the lower part of my abdomen almost nervous the pelvis on both sides.\n\nThe doctor said he really wasn't sure but it could be the beginnings of colitis or Crohn's, so he wanted to refer me to someone with better knowledge on it.", "title": "Recurrent nausea, vomiting and more, no answers...", "author_post": "amiablystuck", "id_post": "dz2nva", "post_author_feedback": true, "pos_post_author_feedback": 1.0, "turn_count": 1, "total_score": 3, "verified_author_flairs": [], "unique_author_counts": 2, "year": 2019, "created_utc": 1574259573, "has_conclusion": 1, "refer_to_hospital": 0.0, "prev_additional_contexts": [], "comment_id": "f9iro7y", "comment_author": "shadoweychameleon1", "comment_body": "NAD but you really should see a GI doctor.

{"thread_id": "t_cl4clwj-0", "post": "Hi, to start out, I'm 22, male, 5'10, 175, average/slim build, Caucasian. \n\nAbout a month or a bit more ago around August 27th, I was helping move some couches into our new apartment. Heavy couches, steep stairs, and I'm not the most fit guy. I got a headache (can't remember the details of it) , but didn't think anything of it, thought it would go away and it was just the exertion. I have no history whatsoever of headaches or anything of that sort. \n\nFor about the next month (up until, say, 3 or 4 days ago), the headache would come and go, but would be very very mild on just my left side, so I didn't think anything of it, so I don't remember exactly how bad it was or all the details because it wasn't a huge pain.\n\n About 3 days ago, I started feeling a migraine type feeling come along before bed, went to bed, and woke up and felt a killer migraine type feeling (I think - I've never really had a true migraine before, I don't think), again, focused on the left side and left eye. Pretty painful, some Excedrin took 90% of it away, but it wore off within 2 or 3 hours and I just dealt with it the reast of the day. \n\nOver the last few days, it has subsided, but not completely. Still a slight headache on the left side only that comes and goes. I'm still having some weird eye feelings, that are hard to describe, that include slight pain, but more often (most of the time) just a feeling like my vision from my left eye is blurry/can't focus 100 percent / general discomfort but I can see fine if I try hard enough. \n\nI'm on a few medications: Paxil 20mg daily , alprazolam 2mg daily (1mg morning / night typically) (working on tapering this with my doctor, but its going slowly, and don't want to make any sudden moves. No changes to this dose at all lately). Also, I was recently prescribed adderral (mid september or so), as my psychiatrist thinks my primary diagnosis may be ADHD instead of simply panic/anxiety/PTSD which he now believes could be secondary, so we are slowly weaning off the Paxil/Alprazolam. I'm 99 percent sure the pain I'm feeling doesn't have anything to do with that, though.  Sorry for so much detail, but because I knew I was going to do heavy lifting, I had no adderal or caffeine the day I was moving the couches. \n\nI do find that when I take the alprazolam as prescribed, it seems to slightly relieve my symptoms for an hour or two max. \n\nSo basically, I guess, should I see a doctor? I do have insurance so it's fine if I have to. I just don't know if I should go to an urgent care or optemologist or headache center (I live in a big city so we have that) or what.  My biggest concern is I'm going to go in and tell them I have a migraine, and they are going to think I'm a drug abuser because of the other controlled substances I take and my age and proximity to a \"party school\", which couldn't be further from the truth about me. (all my controlled substances are only from one single psychiatrist who I've seen consistently for 4 years or so now). I feel like shit sometimes because automatically I feel like doctors look at me suspectly. \n\nIf I haven't been clear, please ask for any clarification.  Thanks so much for any help.

As of two hours ago (over 72 hours later) I'm laying in bed experiencing the worst chest pain of my life. I took two 5mg oxycodone (no apap) for the pain, assuming it was due to the abnormal strenuous activity from the other night. The pain has only gotten worse.

All of those tests have come up with no ill results, chalking it up to panic and anxiety.\n\nThis is not panic nor anxiety, so my assumption is that I strained, pulled or tore something in my chest several nights ago or I'm having a heart problem.\n\nI know drug use is ill-advised and I plan on discontinuing it entirely.\n\nPlease respond quickly, any advice is welcomed.

Since the URT lasted around 3 weeks and I developed oral thrush my doctor sent me to do some blood tests and took a throat swab.\n\nI did a **HIV test** which came back negative, my liver function and renal profile all came back normal however my FBC came back with some abnormalities.  \nMy total WBC is **3.4 x 10\\*9/L**  \nPlatelet count is **139 x 10\\*9/L**  \nNeutrophil count **0.9 x 10\\*9/L**\n\nFor some more background info I have suffered from **neutropenia** and oral thrush in the past however, the neutropenia was drug induced (I dont take it now) and was treated with **folic acid**.  \nI currently only take my inhalers: **Fostair** which I use a spacer for as I know it can cause oral thrush &amp; **Ventolin**  \nMedication: **Fexofenadine** &amp; **Montelukast** which I take on a regular basis. Still finishing off a second course of Nystatin currently.  \nI have a sneaking suspicion that it may be due to the fact I was really ill and at the same time I changed my diet to a vegan diet. Since I dont know which way my neutrophils are going at the moment I dont feel like the nystatin will be an effective treatment since my body isn't fighting off the infection.  \nI'm definitely going to consult my doctor and tell them all of this information when I get the chance but may I be right? Or what do you think it could be? Should I take folic acid for the time being until I see my doc again (Will be in 3 weeks).\n\nThanks in advance for any help, this has stressed me out a bit since I cant figure out an obvious answer.

As in, have been to the doctor and done whatever they needed to get confirmed (I have no idea how that works, I thought menopause wouldn't be a thing for us for at least another decade). I'm totally confused. I have personally never had a normal cycle, but I'm on the IUD and have been for damn near forever. I rarely ever get periods.\n\nAnyway, then we found out my mom got it at 39 and one of her sisters got it at 34. Apparently it's just incredibly normal in our family to get menopause well before 40.
