Also try not to scratch, because that can further irritate other hair follicles and spread the bacteria.   \nIf it doesn't seem to be getting any better at all in another few days, I would recommend you see a doctor to get their opinion since they can do a more thorough exam, and they can give you some antibiotics or maybe a steroid either orally or in a topical cream to help treat it.

False negative rate is around 40%, false positive is typically much lower.  The typical CDC procedure is a two-step process.  The first test is the ELISA. If that is positive they run what's called a western blot to check specific bands of antibodies to borrelia's (the bacteria that causes lyme disease) surface proteins.  It would be ridiculous to get a positive ELISA and then run ANOTHER ELISA.  A positive ELISA is pretty trustworthy.  However, the standard labs that run western blots (quest, labcorp) don't use all the antibody bands that have been linked to borrelia infection, and many standard doctors don't interpret them well.  On top of that, you can get many other infections through a single tick bite; bartonella, babesia, etc.  Do you know if any of your lyme tests were western blots?  \n\nI tested negative through elisa five months ago with my GP, and after chasing down many avenues and getting progressively worse I finally was able to see a doctor who specializes in tick-borne illness and sent my blood to IgeneX labs in CA.

I had spells in which the nausea would get worse, and I would experience vomiting and complete loss of appetite. During these times, my weight would drop significantly. \n\nThe last camera test involved taking biopsies from my stomach, which finally gave me a diagnosis of what my GP described as 'severe thrush.' \n\nI am picking up a course of antibiotics tomorrow, but my question is how the heck did I get thrush in my stomach, and what are the potential dangers of having this issue for so long? I can't seem to find any information on male thrush in the stomach, let alone the potential dangers of such a condition. \n\nI'm fairly sure I have a case of medical negligence, as I was constantly told the nausea was in my head, and that I was young so would get over it.

This is as informed as it gets (I've been researching options for at least 10 years--that's how awful pregnancy and childbirth sounds). In fact the best option (from research that included medical journal articles as well as medical sites and doctor sites) would be hysterectomy because of hormonal issues tied to my menstrual period. It means most birth controls have unacceptable side effects and progesterin only ones are worse. Condoms of any sort are unbearably painful, I also have a nickel allergy so I can't use non hormonal iud. I keep taken off of every pill and the shot for side effects. I never felt better as I did on Lupron but I can't even have that because I had it for a year long. \n\nBut sterilization would reduce my bad days (many little-to-no functioning days) from the entire month to 10 days a month (because wouldn't need birth control). I mean cutting the tubes or even taking part of them out. I can't do Essure because of the nickel allergy.\n\n\nBut doctors won't even talk about either. And they won't talk about it because then I can't have babies. I'm never having babies anyway and if I do they'll be adopted. I've stated this clearly. I've been to many of them since all that I saw here in this city won't even discuss it with me. If they were concerned about medical risks that would be one thing.

{"thread_id": "t_cn313k1-0", "post": "Hi, I hope maybe someone here can shed some light on what's going!\nTo start off, I'll fill you in on my basic info. I'm 31 female 5'7\" 150 lbs and caucasian. Daily I take celexa, wellbutrin, omeprazole, singular, zyrtec and a complete women's multivitamin. All of these I've taken for 2+ years, no new meds added. Existing conditions are asthma, allergies, GERD, depression and anxiety disorder. No change in diet.\nOk, now on to my \"mystery illness\". I'll try to give as much detail as possible. Three weeks ago, I noticed the tops of my feet hurt while walking or bending/flexing my feet. The next day the tops of my hands. A day or two later my ankles and wrists joined. I had no swelling that week until a party that weekend. I was standing a lot and took my shoe off because my right foot felt tight and saw that my foot was very swollen and very painful. Swollen from the ankle down to my toes. The next day, still swollen and barely able to walk on it, I promised my husband I'd go to the family doctor. \nBy the time I could see the doctor, 3 days later, my left wrist and top of my hand was swollen as well. I also started to have pain in my right leg. It was up my leg to my knee. But this was more in the muscles of my leg and the area behind my knee I call my \"knee pit\". I can't bend my wrists, right knee or ankles barely at all. The doctor said she really wasn't sure what to think. I had blood drawn for the typical lab panel as well as one for lyme disease. I told her how much pain I was in. I can barely wash and dry my hair, cook, clean house or work at this point (I use my hands a lot at work for various tedious tasks). I can't even hook my own bra behind my back. I feel pathetic and helpless. She recommend that I use OTC pain relievers. I already knew these haven't helped, but had hopes of getting an answer from the blood tests if wait it out.\nAll of my blood work came back normal, I'm really healthy on paper. At this point I'm very frustrated. She recommended I see a rheumatologist and because of my pleading for relief from this extreme pain, gave me a prescription for tramadol. Later on in the week, I had to call and request something else, tramadol didn't even touch the pain. I feel like they think I'm just asking for random pain killers, they make feel like I'm doing something wrong. But, they prescribed mobic anyway. Still not even worth me taking it. Might as well be a pez candy for all it does. The last few days, a couple fingers have started hurting as well. \nNow, the best way I can describe these pains is comparing it to a sprained wrist/twisted ankle/jammed finger. There is extreme pain when I trip over my dog or bend my wrist while pushing off from my chair to stand. These pains are intense and sharp. Heat or cold packs don't help much, but I've used them on the main swollen areas just for temporary relief.\nI have no history of arthritis or autoimmune disorders in my family. All of my family is really healthy and they think I'm exaggerating. My rheumatoid factor on the lab work was &lt;10 with the cutoff at &lt;=14. \nI can say that I've been under *extreme* stress for months. Money problems and the possibility of losing my house because of these money problems. Because of money issues, I've had anxiety attacks at work and feel fatigued and depressed with all of the problems compounding into an almost explosive situation. My life feels very out of control, especially with this added complication.\nI don't know what to think and I don't know what my next step should be. A rheumatologist I suppose. \nCan anyone help me? Any insight or experience with these types of symptoms would be very much appreciated. I'll answer any questions if there is anything I haven't covered!\nThanks everyone! &lt;3", "title": "My mystery illness - pain and swelling", "author_post": "FancyPants2001", "id_post": "2q4pp4", "post_author_feedback": null, "pos_post_author_feedback": 1.0, "turn_count": 2, "total_score": 5, "verified_author_flairs": ["Medical Student"], "unique_author_counts": 3, "year": 2014, "created_utc": 1419299680, "has_conclusion": 1, "refer_to_hospital": 0.0, "prev_additional_contexts": [], "comment_id": "cn313k1", "comment_author": "bubbabearzle", "comment_body": "Do you know what kinds of blood tests she ran?

Yes, you need to do something about that mattress.  The best mattress to prevent bed sores is a Roho but they are very expensive and you might need an order from a doctor or therapist to get one.  But if all you can get is a foam topper than do it. \n\n It's also super important to keep her skin clean and to protect it with a silicone based barrier cream to prevent anything else from developing.  Don't use baby diaper rash cream - it's going to make things worse!  She needs to be repositioned on a regular basis to relieve pressure on sensitive areas.  Have her lie on her left side, right side and back side, she can't keep pressure on one spot all the time.  With her leg in the brace you'll have to do some propping up with pillows and stuff but you can't let her weight rest on the bed sore continuously.   Bed sores are called \"pressure\" sores for a reason. \n\nDo you have someone coming in to put dressings on her bed sores?  I hate to have to say this but in my working experience I find most of the nurses who do wound care can't do a decent job of putting on dressings for pressure sores on buttocks.  Most of them don't really give a shit and all they care about is to get in and out a.s.a.p..  I'm always having to fix them and have my own kit for fixing up their messes.  Be a bitch if you have to - this is your Mom and you need to be her voice.  Inspect the dressing after it's on and make sure that it looks smooth, secure and that the edges are sealed.  If urine or feces can get under the dressing it's going to be trapped under there along with the sore and you're going to end up with a huge, puss filled hole.  If it looks uneven or has any wrinkles or raised edges have them do it over.\n\nGood luck and my best wishes to your Mom.\n", "comment_is_question": true, "comment_is_response": false, "comment_respond_to": null, "comment_requested_info": "what else can we do?", "comment_question_type": "Symptom elaboration questions", "comment_is_personal_experience": false, "comment_is_medical_knowledge": false, "comment_is_answered": null, "comment_is_relevant": true, "comment_score": 5, "comment_parent_id": "t3_3ix180", "comment_turn_level": 0, "comment_author_flair_text": "This user has not yet been verified.", "comment_created_utc": 1440908976, "qid": "t_cukg752-0-c0-q0", "question": "Do you have someone coming in to put dressings on her bed sores?", "patient_answer": null, "question_type": "Followup", "binary_question": true, "hypotheses": [], "additional_context": "Currently, no one is coming in to put dressings on her bed sores.", "final_diagnosis": "Bed sore development", "conclusion": "The patient should use a foam mattress topper if a Roho mattress is not accessible, maintain skin cleanliness with a silicone-based barrier cream, and regularly reposition to relieve pressure on sensitive areas.", "has_final_diagnosis": 1}

And I know I am being paranoid, but knowing that doesn't help me stop feeling that way. \n\nI am starting to dread night time though. \n\nI have never been a depressed or anxious person but does this sound like it could be related to those things, especially given that it has come up as we were dealt a difficult hand? What are the best ways to get through this myself, without taking time away from family/kids?

Pointless sweating\n5. General feeling of sickness\n6. Weak\n7. Body is generally hot (temperature being normal) with mind losing focus and no strength in the body.\n\nI work from home hence I am inside most of the time except for early morning walks and a gym session in the evening.\n\nI had decided few weeks back that I have suffered enough from this allergy/infection and have taken enough medicines already for the past many years without any comfort. Tests show everything functioning normally in the body.\n\nSo I took off from my home for 4 consecutive weekends and these are the effects that I noticed.\n\n1. After a few hours in an AC room/car I feel better which is followed by sneezing and then I have none of the symptoms stated above except I feel very hungry.\n\n2. Feel full of life and very strong. Mind seems relaxed and focused.\n\n3. But after coming back to home all of the above symptoms return\n\n4. It is not due to my home because I have changed 5 rented homes in the past 6 years. I felt the same everywhere.\n\nI don't have an AC at home to determine if the air/dust or anything else is making me allergic.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what ailment I am suffering from? This thing which appears minor has wreaked havoc on me and my life. I am getting treated from an ENT for the past 1 month and he said it is just allergy and only solution is continuous medicine.\n\nI am currently being given Picnovit dietary supplement.\n\nHowever I feel I am missing some part of the puzzle and if I can get myself healthy I can concentrate on my work and personal life which is moving like a tortoise at this point.\n\nI take adequate water, fruits and eat very healthy foods.\n\nAnyone helping me on this will be doing a huge favour as I have been to every good doctor (physician, ENT, gastro, ayurveda) but all of them only accept it as an allergy.

My gut sense is that you should meet with a counselor on the off chance that you are indeed a carrier. If one of your parents also has the genetic change (as opposed to a de novo genetic development in your brother,) your family should speak to genetic counsellors about this. Where I am in the Pac NW, in the system that I work, you would be covered for the counseling and testing. YMMV. If you have a minimally expressed case, your children would have a 50-50 chance of having TS. This is the kind of potential disease that you would probably not want to pass on if you carry the gene.

{"thread_id": "t_cx73m9q-0", "post": "Hey guys!  Thanks in advance for looking this over, and I apologize for it being so long but I'm really trying to be thorough.  I'm a 27-year-old caucasian female from south FL, approximately 5'2\" and currently 140 lbs.  For the past month and a half I've been experiencing terrible, debilitating nausea and abdominal discomfort.  I also have NO appetite -- just the thought of eating makes me feel nauseous.  When I do try to eat I can only ever manage a few bites before I feel uncomfortably full.  \n\nThe situation escalated to the point where I lost about 8 lbs in a week and a half (went from 150-142) and I finally went to see a GI in mid-October. They performed an ultrasound of my gallbladder (clean!) and also did some blood work, which also came back clean.  The GI prescribed me 10mg dicyclomine to be taken 3 times a day, as well as a week long course of ciprofloxacin.  I responded well to the dicyclomine at first -- my first two days on the pills I felt almost normal.  But it started to have some diminishing returns pretty quickly, so I spoke with my GI and decided to take it four times a day.  Once again, I'm experiencing some diminishing returns and I am now taking dicyclomine five times a day.  He also recommended I take 20g omeprazole twice a day, which I have been doing for several weeks.  I saw him for a followup on Weds and explained I was still experiencing nausea and difficulty eating, so he's now added a probiotic (Align, taken I believe once daily?  I haven't started yet, I ordered the pills online and they should be arriving today) and he suggested taking a Tums before bedtime (which I have done for the last few days, using \"ultra strength\" Tums.)\n\nLike I said, the medication seemed to work at first.  I went from 142 to 144-46, and I was starting to function almost normally.  I still couldn't eat a lot but the nausea seemed to be resolved by the medication.  After a week I had to increase the dosage but it still mostly resolved my nausea.  Things are looking kind of bleak lately though.  I took my morning dose of omeprazole and dicyclomine about two hours ago and I'm still feeling nauseous, although a bit better than I did this morning.  The nausea is bad enough right now that I don't feel like I could function comfortably outside of my apartment.  I'm also starting to lose weight again (which yay, I guess, but I really wanted to get there through proper diet and exercise, not because I can't eat food.)\n\nSome more relevant information: I experienced a similar situation back in March/April where I felt nauseous and unable to eat.  This lasted about 3-4 weeks, and was not nearly as serious as the nausea I experience now.  I just stuck to a diet of simple chicken broth and saltines until my stomach settled, which it eventually did.  I didn't see a doctor for that.  I had also been losing weight intentionally prior to my stomach issues, approximately 25 lbs before these shenanigans began. Back in June I experienced SEVERE, sharp abdominal pain that lasted for about 4-5 days.  I saw the GI back then as well and he said it was likely a gallbladder attack from the weight loss and he gave me a prescription, but by that point I was actually getting better on my own and didn't end up taking the medication.  Eventually the pain went away completely and I was totally fine pretty much until October when this whole mess started.\n\nSince this is a GI problem I should probably discuss my bowel movements.  Mostly it's been kind of inconsistent, probably because of how wildly my eating habits vary lately.  Some mornings I'll produce several large, soft BMs, other days it's almost nothing all day -- small, hard BMs.  Lately it's been almost nothing, I suspect because I'm having so much trouble eating.  But who knows?  Urine seems to be pretty normal, at least to me.  \n\nThe nausea is basically constant but I've only thrown up once this whole time back in October, and what I threw up was literally just a pill and water.  (There was nothing else in my system.)  I feel like if I pushed myself to eat more it would probably end up making me vomit, but I haven't really wanted to try that yet.  Also, the nausea seems to come in waves: it's always present, but sometimes it just gets SO MUCH WORSE before ebbing back to a lower level.  Aside from the nausea I get occasional stomach discomfort (not pain, more like a terrible gnawing sensation, it might just be hunger at this point honestly), fatigue (might be hunger or the dicyclomine), and rarely I get chills (again, probably hunger).  Also, when I went to the GI on Weds it took them a LONG time to get a blood pressure reading for me.  Multiple attempts on each arm, until finally the fifth time the nurse wrapped the sleeve around my forearm and managed to get a reading.  I don't recall what it was but the nurse didn't comment on it, so I'm assuming it was within normal range.  She said the difficulty getting a reading on my blood pressure was probably due to dehydration.  It's pretty difficult for me to swallow liquids without nausea at this point, so it makes sense.  I'm gonna try sipping on some Gatorade today to see if it'll help me be a little less dehydrated.\n\nFull disclosure: before my stomach started misbehaving I vaporized marijuana recreationally, anywhere from .1g to .5g a day.  I used to partake rarely back when I was in California, primarily by using edibles.  I stopped for 6 months after moving from California to a fully illegal state and only resumed usage back in early August.  All told I've probably enjoyed weed for a total of about a little over a year, but only since August did I become a daily user. Vaporizing the larger amounts (like .5g/day) is also a fairly recent development that I started in RESPONSE to my nausea, I was definitely using smaller amounts when this all started.  I'm mentioning this because I have heard of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, and while I'm fairly certain I don't have CHS I figure it's worth throwing out there as an option.  I will say that I just took a hot shower that seemed to relieve my symptoms temporarily, but again I almost never vomit (which I understand is a hallmark symptom of CHS and CVS) so it just doesn't seem very likely.  I'm abstaining from marijuana for the next few days just to be sure, but I have to say that it is difficult because marijuana is about the only thing that seems to reliably alleviate my symptoms.  It's also the only way I can manage to eat more than two bites of something without wanting to puke it all back up.  On that note, if cannabis isn't the cause of my symptoms is it still safe for me to use it to treat my nausea?  (Yes, I understand \"safe\" is kind of a relative term when you're getting it from a dealer rather than a medical dispensary, but I do trust my guy and nobody else appears to be getting sick from his product.)  I understand that marijuana can slow gut motility, and if my issue is related to gastroparesis then I definitely don't want to exacerbate the problem, you know?  I have not yet disclosed my marijuana usage to my GI (he hasn't asked yet and he's a friend of the family, so I can't help but feel a little paranoid that he'd tell my folks) but if it is relevant I will obviously do so.\n\nExtra relevancy in case anyone thinks it might be IBS: I menstruated this week and it didn't really seem to effect my symptoms, either for better or for worse, but as my period tapered off the nausea started to get really bad.  Other than that it was a pretty normal period.  Not sure if it's relevant, but I know IBS symptoms can worsen during menstruation.   \n\nAnd I think that's about it?  To me the current possibilities seem like it might be IBS, Crohn's, gastroparesis...  But I'm not a doctor, thank god!  My GI thinks it's either my gallbladder or a particularly nasty virus -- he said some might cause symptoms for up to six months, so I guess it's possible!  But I'd love to hear any feedback you guys might have.  I have another followup with my GI scheduled for December but if the nausea continues like this and abstaining from marijuana doesn't resolve the issue then I might bump that up a couple of weeks.  It's really, really hard to live like this.  Right now the dicyclomine helps a little but it's just not enough anymore.  Any and all help/insight you guys could offer would just be hugely appreciated.

I haven't had sex in two months (with an ex boyfriend that I was with since august) so I don't know if it's an std. He claims to have been tested after we broke up, too. And that his results weren't positive.\n\nThe other night I come home from work after an overtime shift...and once I got comfortable, my vagina started itching like CRAZY. Like, so much that I even started to slap and punch it. It was AWFUL. I also noticed a thick white discharge when I went to the bathroom. Sounds like a yeast infection, right? That's what I thought...but then the same night, I start getting a brown discharge....then the next day its a LOT of brown discharge. So last night I decided to wear a pad because I also started spotting. So when i come home from dinner with friends, my pad is fresh with a LOT of BROWN... And only a little blood. \n\nAnd this morning, just now, I check my new pad...and there's nothing. I also got slight cramps here and there yesterday...but they were very temporary. I analyzed my vagina with a mirror to check for any signs, and I see that one side of my labia is pale...like, discolored. When the rest is all pink and just vagina-colored. And it hurt when I touched the inside of my vagina.\n\nI don't know if this is also important, but a couple days earlier i threw up at work and had terrible nausea. But I figured it was just the chipotle I had a day prior...but just in case, I'm including that. No sex for two months. So I don't know what it is. I made an appointment with a gyno next Thursday....so we'll see what she says but for now I just want a clue, if i can even get one. Please help.

Looking online, there are actually some pretty convincing arguments for taking it to combat cancer (look up \"Rick Simpson Oil\"). He is pretty weak, has already gone through 5 infusions of chemo (it stopped working), immunotherapy, and palliative radiation treatments.\n\nAnyways, my Dad is currently on the Fentanyl patch for severe pain due to metastases in his back. I plan to make him cannabis oil (THC) to not only assist him with his pain, but also to perhaps assist with his treatment.\n\nQuestion: are Fentanyl and Cannabis known to have a severe adverse interaction? He is not on any other serious meds besides his twice-monthly immunotherapy treatment (Nivolumab / Opdivo), which also doesn't appear to be working.\n\nDETAILS:\n\nAge: 75\n\nGender: Male\n\nHeight/Weight: 5 feet, 6 inches / 170lbs\n\nRace: Italian\n\nThank you docs!!!\n\nedit: please no responses such as \"this won't work\", as we'll likely try it either way.

{"thread_id": "t_db519em-0", "post": "This post is regarding my wife.  white female 32,  175lbs living in the Midwest.  She has been hospitalized for excessive vomiting  5 times in the past 3 years.  It got to the point where she was forced to leave her job. So far  the prescribed medications have not helped her symptoms.  She was diagnosed with cyclical vomiting syndrome,  but beyond that have not been given a definitive cause. \n\nMy wife is a life long asthmatic.  She was diagnosed with pcos and type 2 diabetes about 14 years ago.  About 4 years ago she had her gallbladder removed due to lack of function.  The first time she was admitted for the vomiting she was diagnosed with gastroparesis.  \n\nThe vomiting usually starts off with heavy mucus and leads into vomiting pure bright  yellow bile.  Antiemetics have no effect on the vomiting.  When she is admitted she is found to have high blood sugar and in diabetic ketoacidosis.   She then is given high doses of insulin which doesn't bring her blood sugar down until the vomiting subsides.  Her wbc is always elevated as well.  Somewhere between 8 to 9 thousand.\n\nThe first time she was admitted it took 10 days for her to stop vomiting.  The second time was for 5 days; third for 3 days; fouth for an overnight,  and the fifth for 8 days.  \nThe vomiting would usually start while she was at work and would usually stop after she got home and got some sleep.  The vomiting seems to be aggravated by allergens such as dust and cigarette smoke,  but can be triggered with seemingly no cause. \n\nShe watches her blood sugar and is usually between 110 and 125. When the vomiting begins it shoots up to 250 to 400. Insulin and metformin has no effect on it at that point.  \n\nThe only remedy we have found that has any positive effect is cannabis.  As long as she can get some in her system before the vomiting gets out of hand she is fine. After over 2 years of daily vomiting she is finally to a state where she can function and is only vomiting on rare occasions. Unfortunately we live in a state where cannibis is illegal.   She recently applied for a job but was rejected fue to thc being found on her drug screening. \n\nDoes anyone know of any other remedy for cvs or what what else this could be.  We have very large medical bills from the extended hospital stays and a plethora of specialists. We are currently without insurance. \n\nIf you want more information on the multitude of tests she has underwent or more case history,  I can share.

It's hard, so I'm not sure it's an abscess (but I'm not a doc so I have no idea). \nI'm trying to avoid going to the hospital, but my OBGYN is closed tomorrow (Merry Christmas), and I haven't had any luck searching online. \nAny ideas? \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been tested for STD/STIs and are monogamous. \nI have some left over amoxicillin, should I start on that for now? \n\nI dont know if this is related but I've been extremely fatigued the last week or so with a head cold/stomach bug.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: next day, I'm at urgent care. GYN doesn't have an opening until 1/25... here goes nothing.\n\nEdit 2: Bartholin + a shot in the vag. Merry Christmas to me.

I had my surgery on the 6th of Oct. I'm able to passively move my fingers quite well, but actively I can only move the tip slightly while finger blocking. I had my injury in zone 2 \"no man's land\" as they refer to it. I'm trying to remain positive, because keeping a healthy mind is integral to all of this.

I'm considering a 2nd surgery as well to remove all the scar tissue, but I've heard that this recovery can stagnate and improve slowly for a few years, so I'm skeptical if I should wait it out or... Oh, I lacerated my flexors. Extensors are more likely to return to normal function, so keep the optimism up. I'm in a less-promising situation :/ Did you have nerve injury?

I had about 3 main passive exercises (if you'd like a more in-depth description of what they are, let me know and I'll do that for you) about 4-5 active ones. They have this little tool which is a handheld machine thing with a vibrating head on it. They usually put some cocoa butter on the swivel vibrating head piece and massage the areas where I have scar tissue the thickest. I'd strongly suggest buying vitamin e gel capsules and breaking them open and rubbing that gel into your scar. I wore my splint for like 5 weeks. I was told to keep it on for a week or so more, but I find it inhibits more than anything at this point. I'm a bit wary though, because I think the splint position is important to recovery. It's not just about protection. And don't worry, anything you share I'm open to hearing. Good dieting is important to.

At night time when I'm tired, I have hallucinations sometimes. \n\n\nAside from the hallucinations, other problems I have are on and off numbness, almost constant headaches, episodes of vertigo, neck stiffness, very frequent urination (like every 15 minutes), sensitivity to lights, sounds, and smells, and off and on muffled hearing.\n \n\nI'm sure I'm forgetting some symptoms, but my point is that when I go down a list of problems that can be caused by CSF leaks or other CSF problems, I find myself going, \"Yep, yep, yep, yep,\" but a doctor has never once brought CSF up. I've had MRIs to check for MS or structural brain problems, various blood tests, and balance testing. All of that came back normal. \n\n\nI don't want to  be one of those annoying patients who diagnose themselves on the internet. I just want to not live like this anymore. It's pure torture, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. The past few weeks, the brain fog and headaches have been BAD, so I'm thinking about calling Monday and seeing if I can go back to the neurologist. (I think it might have all been made worse by going on a roller coaster, but that's just a guess). I just imagine he'll do the same thing he always does and say it's all anxiety/depression (I can't go to another neurologist because of my insurance, but I have seen others in the past, and they've all done the same thing more or less). Is it possible this is a CSF problem? Is it even worth bringing it up, or is it so unlikely that I'll just be brushed off in seconds?\n\n\nI'm 28, female, 5'0\", 124 lbs, caucasian, and in the USA. I don't take any medications regularly. I occasionally take an Imitrex when the headache and migraine-ish symptoms get really bad, though I don't really know why because it doesn't help much if any. \n\n\nI am sorry this is so scatter-brained.

I had a panic attack (I think) and just about thought i was having a stroke.  I had tunnel vision, pins and needles in my fingers, increased heart rate, faintness.  It lasted about an hour.\n\nTwo weeks later, I've been feeling low on energy, I have history of depression.  When I lay down to go to sleep, I keep feeling jolts in my chest that seem like heart flutters.  Then it feels like my BP drops, I get faint, sweaty palms, increased heart rate. Hyperventilating. I try to do breathing exercises to calm down.  I go into full panic mode.  I get very faint, confused, anxious, sense of impending doom as is my heart is going to stop.  I convince myself that it was just a panic attack like two weeks before.\n\nAfter a couple hours, I finally manage to fall asleep.  I JOLT awake at 6 am after only a few hours asleep to what feels like another heart flutter (again, can't confirm it is a flutter it just feels that way). A few minutes later I managed to fall asleep again but I JOLT awake even harder straight to my and start hyperventilating, burst into tears from fear and tiredness and drive to the hospital.\n\nAt the hospital, I tell the same story.  The doc orders an EKG, a bunch of blood work, urine tox and a chest x-ray.  They come up empty.  I seem healthy, however, they didn't test for T3/T4.  Also, I did a bump of cocaine last weekend and that shows up in the UT.  So, they diagnose me with panic disorder and drug use.  Discharged.\n\nHere's the thing, I don't feel like I have panic disorder.  I don't have any history of it.  This is a physical problem that's happening in my body and causing me to panic.  It happens intermittently but almost ALWAYS when I lay down to rest.  It happens in my sleep, or when I'm awake.\n\nSo tonight it happened again, and I'm sitting on the couch doing the best I can to recover from it, but now I have a fear of lying down.\n\nI've researched my symptoms and it seems like it could be hyperthyroidism.

I've been going to physicians, eye doctors, and sinus experts and my problem has worsened to the point where it is impossible for me to look, focus, or read in a straight line. This has hindered my school work considerable, made part-time work needlessly cumbersome, ruined certain recreational activities, and has made life generally miserable.\n\nLong story long: about about three or so years, the peripheral vision in my right eye was becoming modestly worse; it had become harder to see movement and environments on my far-right side. I took a peripheral vision exam (and was never contacted the results, so I guess that's a good sign?) and had learned to just deal with it. I then got my vision rechecked by an optometrist who noticed nothing unusual beyond a discrepancy of vision loss between the two eyes; my suspicion that one of my eyes had become lazy was therefore thwarted (I guess, since he probably would have noticed that) and I got a new pair of glasses that would hopefully accommodate me.\n\nSince then, my right eye's ability to focus without strain had worsened and had been coupled by other concurrent issues. I started experiencing heavy sinusitis on my right side and decided to visit a sinus specialist, who then found an infection and gave my some Nasonex so treat it. Though subsequent visits showed that the infection has depleted, clogging and difficulty breathing had still persisted. He booked a cranal scan for my sinus and mid-head area (and I was never contacted the results, so I guess that's a good sign?) though since there was no longer a visible infection, all he could do was recommend for me to continue with the Nasonex.\n\nWell, I've been taking Nasonex since then but the problem has not subsided and I've further noticed a numbing of my right side; sensations were increasingly numb, my eyelid had become droopy and facial movements have been biased to my left side. I grew paranoid and wondered if my stimulants (like Ritalin or Sudafed) was causing this so I ceased treatment and sought advice from my doctor. He informed me that it was possibly Bell's Palsy and that the issue was either gonna fix itself or stay permanent. Welp, suppose that was earnest insight though the numbness was worsened to the point where I can literally feel numb on my right side - whether I'm on or off of meds. There's no visual palsy beyond that crooked smile though I do notice that my vision mildly improves if I use my hand to forcefully lift my right eyelid.\n\nBasically, this has gotten so bad that I can't focus my right eye well enough to read. My academic performance has dropped to the point of failed standing and I can no longer read anything past the midway of a sentence without having to blink profusely or look away due to strain. It's agonizing, and I feel like a hypochondriac since any inquiry I've ever made has yielded no answers.\n\nAm I losing my mind? Have I been seeing the wrong people? Are all these problems unrelated?\n\nIf anyone has any feedback, huge thanks in advance.

However, after consulting with the chief neurologist at a top Boston hospital, who took her concerns seriously, she finally underwent a comprehensive tilt table test with a biopsy.

That is the duration that we use for patients with arguably more severe infections like  CAP (depending on other patient risk factors). \n\nIn terms of antibiotic prescribing, we are trying to push away from long duration of antibiotics as it can increase antibiotic resistance which is a becoming a massive problem. Your doctor has probably weighed up the risks and benefits, with yourself being a young and otherwise healthy persom, it wouldn't warrant a long course of antibiotics. That being said, if in the discussion with your doctor, he mentioned that it could possibly caused by bacteria, then you should notice an improvement in symptoms after taking it for about 48 hrs and definitely after the 5 days, as the antibiotics will have reached a level to start working. If you are not improving or symptoms worsen, then the bacteria aren't responding to the antibiotic, and you may need a different antibiotic that the bacteria are susceptible to (increasing duration on resistant bacteria won't help the infection). This is of course only if the infection is bacterial. If viral, antibiotics will not help, and personally I wouldn't treat as symptoms are generally self-limiting and don't last overly long. \n\nNot a doctor, but a pharmy \n\nEdit: also should note that antimicrobial resistance patterns would also have an effect on treatment.

{"thread_id": "t_ecfzh3o-0", "post": "So, I am a 27 year old female, 5’2, 128lbs white, USA. I don’t take any medication. I have been having chest pains for a few years now. They are really intense and get worse if I take a deep breath. Normally it just hurts right under my breast on the left side. It’s like a burning sharp pain. Sometimes I barely notice it, sometimes it’s insanely painful. When it’s at its worst it effects other parts of my body. My stomach also hurts, mostly next to my left hip bone. my neck, jaw, and shoulder become stiff and hurt, and then I can’t feel my left arm and it’s in pain. Like it’s dead weight and tingly but it still hurts. \n\nSo I went to see a doctor about it, I haven’t been since I was a kid so this was a new doctor. I told him my problem and he did a blood test, which came back normal. So he said it’s probably nothing and that I’m probably fine. I hate going to the doctor so I was like “cool.” And left. A couple months ago I had a really bad one, and my BF wanted me to go to the ER but I refused. So the next day he convinced me to go to instacare. They did chest X-rays and an ekg. The Dr. there said that my left lung looked strange to her. She said that some people would look over it and give me a call, but no one ever did. She also told me to check in with me GP, so I did. This time he didn’t do any tests, just said the instacare Dr. was over reacting and that even though he didn’t see the X-ray, that I was fine. So again, I took him at his word\n\nBut I got the flu a few weeks ago, and went to instacare. Everything was normal but they left the heart monitor thing they put on your finger on the whole visit. Which I didn’t really think anything of, I thought they just forgot about it. \nBut at the end the Dr. looked at the thing on my finger and said “the whole time you have been here your heart rate has risen and fallen really fast.” And she wanted me to do another ekg, and said my heart rate was really fast during it. She asked me if I was pregnant, which I said no. She said that I might have a blood clot in my lung. She wanted me to do a pregnancy test but I got really freaked out about the whole thing and told her I would take one at home. She told me to call her immediately if it was positive. I did But it was negative, so I just forgot about it. \n\nAlso I’m unsure if it’s related, but my left arm has become super weak. I can’t lift it above my chest without losing feeling and it hurts constantly.\n\nAnyways, I don’t want to pay to go back to my doctor again just for him to tell me I’m over reacting. I’ve been three times, two were for this problem and every time I go he says I’m fine or tries to put me on anti depressants I don’t want. Do you think this is serious?

At least 3+ years. It's in an area I shave regularly so I always just sort of assumed it was an ingrown hair or something. Its pretty deep under the skin though so I never bothered it. And it didn't bother me. It didn't hurt or anything. Weeeellllll, a few nights ago I (again, I know I'm stupid) I noticed there was a little black mark on my lump and I thought maybe it was the hair pushing out so I decided to poke it and see if I could get whatever it was out. Well, it didn't work and I saw a little bit of cloudy liquid so I squeezed it. And a little more liquid came out. It still wasn't hurting. I squeezed a little more and at this point I decided it wasn't worth causing more damage than necessary so I stopped. It felt fine for the rest of that night and the next day it was mildly sore and I just chalked that up to messing with it. Fast forward to today, and it's definitely way more swollen. The black lump is now kind of small and sunken in compared to the larger red lump that is now around it. \nI'm hoping I just irritated the hell out of it and it's just swollen from that. I have a doctor's appointment on the 6th of January and im hoping I can make it till then to have it looked at but I gotta be honest, I also don't want to get some sort of infection or wait too long and have something bad happen. \nI know I shouldn't have messed with it. It was stupid. I genuinely regret doing it \nMy question is , should I go to an urgent care or is that an overkill? Or should I just wait till the 6th?\n\nEdit: sorry, I should specify that it does hurt. Not a sharp pain or anything, just generally sore. Also painful if I press on it.

Go to sleep between 3 and 6 am. With a total between 4 to 6 hours of sleep a day. (I don't feel tired and I get some pretty nice dreams tho)\n* My diet is pretty balanced, a bit of rice, beans, some veggies and sometimes meat (it's getting expensive around here). I don't eat breakfast, but I have lunch, two snacks in the evening, and dinner.\n* I am not a fan of \"junk food\", like candy or fast food.\n* My father is overweight, my mother is obese 1 bordering 2, my brother is at most a bit chubby. (am currently living with my mother and brother)\n* All of my blood tests results seem healthy. (last time I did them was about 6 months ago)\n\nAbout me always feeling hot...  \nI don't know when it started, I remember starting to feel weak on summer when I was about 19. But as time goes on, it only seems to worsen.  \nThe average temperature on where I live seems to be between 20ºC (68ºF) to 25ºC (77ºF). For most people I know, this is comfortable, for me it's torture.  \nMy window is always open, my table fan is always on, I can't wear anything else other than t-shirts and shorts.  \nIt's not that I feel \"oh, wow, it's hot huh...\", it's more like I'm always on the verge of a heatstroke. But the thermometer always show 37ºC (98.6ºF)  \nI remember when it was winter here around mid july, I had to leave 5 in the morning, it was 5ºC (41ºF), my hair was wet, really windy, and all I had on was a shirt, t-shirt and jeans, the shirt which I had to remove later.  \nWhen it's a bit cold (between 10ºC and 15ºC) I get really hyped up and can get a lot of stuff done. When it's hot (anything above 20ºC) I feel extremely sluggish, and when it hits 30ºC, I honestly can't do anything, moving my body becomes a hassle and simple things (like taking a shower or going grocery shopping) makes me either have to rest every 5 minutes or makes me collapse.  \nI don't seem to sweat as much as expected from the heat I seem to feel.  \nMy weight also hasn't changed in the last 7 years, doesn't matter how much of a lazy couch potato or healthy crossfitter I try to be.\n\n*ps. I am sorry if this only seemed like a rant, but I don't know how to explain exactly how I feel.*  \n*pss. I am sorry for any grammar mistakes, haven't been able to practive my english as much.*\n\nI will try to answer any questions and update any useful info requested. \n\n**Thank you!**", "title": "Why do I feel excessive heat?", "author_post": "Francis_T", "id_post": "e6rxtl", "post_author_feedback": true, "pos_post_author_feedback": 1.0, "turn_count": 2, "total_score": 3, "verified_author_flairs": ["Medical Student"], "unique_author_counts": 2, "year": 2019, "created_utc": 1575598469, "has_conclusion": 1, "refer_to_hospital": 0.0, "prev_additional_contexts": [], "comment_id": "f9stv19", "comment_author": "fooerer", "comment_body": "All your blood tests were \"excessively normal\"?

{"thread_id": "t_fa9aa5k-0", "post": "This started about 2 nights ago. \n\nShe came home from work at night and seemed distraught over a customer at the end of her shift, a man cane in and gave her a real hard time over some meatballs for his sub. She did what she was supposed to, and that was that. She seemed shaken by it, kinda on the verge of breaking down.\n\nTime jump, Yesterday she picked me up from work to take me to an appointment and she's talking very spasticly. Fast speech. Almost constant I would say. She would curse a lot and mutter stuff to herself. We get back home and She goes to work then comes home. She had a similar night evidently and she's got this same shaken tone. She talks constantly, and switches from elated speech and moods to where it looks like she's about to cry. Throughout this time period and in the car from earlier she would say things that were very off-the-wall. For example, at the house she randomly asked me if I remembered. I asked her what, and she explained when I spoke to her about \"the war and the black opps\" that apparently happened minutes prior that I certainly didnt speak on. \n\nAnother example is she said she was glad our baby son had pants. I responded with \"oh yeah?\" And she explained he had pants like hers that go up and down and up and down. Very odd stuff like that occasionally. \n\nShe has also talked about being depressed and wanting to kill herself but made it a point she wasnt going to do anything. \n\nLater that night she spent about an hour or so having an emotional conversation about how sorry she was for certain events in our past, and how she's messed up and sees a difference in my attitude because of her actions. \n\nToday she's been doing fairly similar stuff, sometimes it's hard to understand what she's talking about when she explains something to me. \n\nAs of right now I am at a family members house with my son. I begged her to check herself in tonight. I'm contemplating letting her mother know who is aware of her acting off lately. \n\nShe doesn't have a history that I know of of acting anything like this. Sometimes when she's stressed she can exaggerate a situation and get overly mad about it, becoming very emotional and almost hyperventilating but nothing much more than that. She has told me she's been depressed before.\n\n\nEDIT: Uodates will be posted soon\n\nEDIT 2: Update will be longer than expected. Give me some time to sort this mess and work through it and I will be back with word, hopefully sooner than later.\n\nEDIT 3: I'm going to save some details, but my wife WAS on stimulants. From what the history of the past week, and some prior depression, I think it may have made it worse. She told me she it was only a bump. Now, I can vouch for a bump being insane, but she thinks maybe it was laced which is a possibility. \n\nThank you to everyone who shared concerns and all who responded. I appreciate the help so much, and am so grateful. I'm going to take steps healthy that can hopefully prevent from this ever happening again, which I know mostly deals with our relationship.

It’s worth noting  I hadn’t yet gotten my flu shot, but I wasn’t all that concerned, as when I’m in public, I keep my hands away from my face when they aren’t clean, always wash my hands before I eat anything, and even open doors with my shirt covering my hand.\nI left after a few hours. The following evening, my throat was ever so slightly sore. That’s a big red flag for me, but I went to bed and hoped it wasn’t going to be brutal. I woke up the next morning with a hellish pain in my throat. It hurt to swallow. It hurt to drink. It hurt. Period. My ears were popping and aching as well. I went to assess the damage and noticed white blotches behind my uvula, which seemed off. After a few hours and two Ibuprofen, the throat pain was pretty minimal, though my ears were still popping.

I was still coughing up phlegm, and my cough was now a constant symptom, but my throat felt pretty okay. Nonetheless, I went to the clinic that evening. I explained my symptoms, and requested a strep test, which they obliged. The test came back negative, and the doctor said apart from my ears having some fluid in them, it seemed like a normal viral infection. Since I didn’t have a fever, headaches or chills, I also got my flu shot while I was there. Truthfully, I still wasn’t entirely convinced by the strep test, as I recall having strep when I was younger that only showed itself in a bacteria culture a few days after I went to the doctor and had the quick strep test come back negative. I figured, as a walk in clinic, they might not have been prepared to do a bacteria culture, so I didn’t say anything. I was told to come back if my ears got worse, and that was that. The next day (yesterday), I woke up and I was worse. My throat hurt again, I was awfully congested, my ears ached, and my cough was even more aggressive. I took Ibuprofen and it didn’t help. I ended up canceling my plans, went back to sleep for a few hours, and when I woke up, I felt considerably better. Not good, but better. My symptoms were just less aggressive. I wasn’t completely alarmed by this because I figured maybe it would just get worse before it gets better. Went about my day, and went to bed. Finally, we’re at today. I wake up, and my throat felt even worse. My nose was stuffed, I was congested, my ears hurt, and I had a splitting headache. I took some Ibuprofen and went back to sleep.

{"thread_id": "t_faraahz-0", "post": "Nausea every time I eat, no matter what I eat\n\nThis first started in 2017 when I returned to the US after living in South America for about a year. I hated eating because it made me nauseous. But not like “I’m going to throw up” nauseous, but just supremely uncomfortable. And it’s a very distinct sensation I’ve only experienced with whatever this is that’s happening to me. It’s like nausea but... in my throat? Like right behind my clavicle region. I honestly thought I contracted a worm or something my last few days in South America, but being a genius and never went to a physician about it.\n\nWell after about 6 months of that I started eating vegetarian and somehow that fixed it for me. I know longer had that sensation (And never found any evidence of worms). Fast forward to the last 2 months and it has started back up (admittedly I stopped eating vegetarian for about a year), but now even when I try to eat vegetarian habitually I still feel the horribly uncomfortable sensation. It’s almost advanced, to the point that drinking water aggravates it. But other times, I’ll be really nauseous and when I finally force myself to eat, it goes away. Sometimes I eat and nothing is wrong. \n\nI think I will start a log of what I eat and how I feel. Maybe that would help if it’s something in my diet. \n\nMy sister once described being nauseous but “in her throat” which is the only time I’ve heard anyone else be able to relate to the feeling, but neither of my parents. However, she never related anything as irritating as what I am experiencing. My other sister has issues with her gall bladder, but the nausea this causes her when she eats the wrong foods often ends up with her vomiting. I have never done so with my... whatever it is. \n\nAny insights?? I just want to know how I can alleviate this horror\n\nEdit: and I don’t know if it matters but I’m not into alcohol, tobacco, drugs.... really anything. Pretty vanilla. I’m a 22M and I wouldn’t say I’m real overweight, but I might be a lil chubs. Although, I’m still in good physical condition mostly (meaning I can run an 8 minute mile without struggling very much). 6’1” ~205 lbs, I’m on whatever generic brand of Zoloft (100mg daily) for depression.

My name is Aaron, I’m a 24 year old male, and I live in Canada. \n\nFor as far back as I can remember, I’ve been sick what I felt has been way more often than any of my friends. I didn’t realize at the time, but every single time I’ve been sick (aside from maybe the odd cold?) has been the EXACT SAME symptoms - this includes a fever of typically 38.9, a very sore throat, congestion, and a cough.\n\nInitially, my mom and I believed I was constantly getting strep throat over and over again, so I would be treated as if it was and it would eventually go away. Like I said I don’t have a ton of memory on everything back then because I didn’t think anything of it at the time.\n\nThen, we come to the last few years. I started to notice the pattern about 2 years ago when I first met my girlfriend. I got extremely sick like I usually do on New Years, and it lasted a couple of weeks like it usually does - but about 3 weeks later, I got sick again. Same symptoms. Fast forward to February, about a month later, I’m sick again with the same symptoms. March, about a month later again - same symptoms. April, about 3 weeks later, I’m sick again with the same symptoms as always.\n\nIt was around this time that my mom and I noticed that nobody ever gets sick from me. I’m never, ever contagious - it almost seems like my body’s reaction to something rather than an illness. \n\nThis pattern continued for about a year, up until last New Years when I got sick again. I finally had enough and I decided to go to a walk in and explain my situation. I met a doctor who finally was willing to look into what this could be, rather than just marking it off as a cold or strep throat. He gave me some forms to get bloodwork done once when I was healthy, and again when I was sick. \n\nI waited until I was sick to get my bloodwork done, but, to my surprise, I didn’t get sick this year until about 9 months later. Come October, sure enough i was sick with the same symptoms as always. I got my bloodwork done while I was sick, and to my surprise all of my results came back normal EXCEPT - I had a CRP level of 49.9. I’m lucky enough to be dating and living with my girlfriend who is a Registered Nurse, and she explained to me that a high CRP level indicates some sort of swelling in the body, and could really be chalked up to anything.\n\nSo, when I was healthy, I went back to get my blood work done. After getting it done, I went back into the same walk in clinic and spoke with the doctor who was willing to look into what it could be.\n\nHe explained to me that my CRP had spiked to 49.9 while I was sick, and had fallen back down to 0.77 while I was healthy. He said that usually with something like a cold or the flu, you could expect to see CRP levels of 13 or so due to a cough or a sore throat causing some swelling - but he said because it spiked to high, he thinks we could be on the right track and it could be something else.\n\nOne thing we’re looking into is something called Periodic Fever Syndrome. This is usually (rarely) found in children, and typically doesn’t last until adulthood. Some adults however can even more rarely be diagnosed with this.\n\nWith all of that being said, that brings me to today. I was sick about a month ago, and surprise surprise I’m sick again. Last night my fever started out at around 37.9 when I noticed it, and I woke up about an hour and a half ago with a fever of 38.8 (Celsius of course). \n\nI’m going to wait a few days, and when whatever this is is at its peak, I’m going to get bloodwork again to see if my CRP spikes back up again. If it does, the doctor said he will most likely try to treat it as if it’s Periodic Fever Syndrome:\n\nThe reason I’m writing in is to see if anyone else has something like this, or if any doctors have any opinions or insight they would be willing to share. \n\nI’m so tired of being constantly sick.

{"thread_id": "t_fb0chpm-0", "post": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m sorry for the long title, I just wanted to get as much info in as I could. My name is Aaron, I’m a 24 year old male, and I live in Canada. \n\nFor as far back as I can remember, I’ve been sick what I felt has been way more often than any of my friends. I didn’t realize at the time, but every single time I’ve been sick (aside from maybe the odd cold?) has been the EXACT SAME symptoms - this includes a fever of typically 38.9, a very sore throat, congestion, and a cough.\n\nInitially, my mom and I believed I was constantly getting strep throat over and over again, so I would be treated as if it was and it would eventually go away. Like I said I don’t have a ton of memory on everything back then because I didn’t think anything of it at the time.\n\nThen, we come to the last few years. I started to notice the pattern about 2 years ago when I first met my girlfriend. I got extremely sick like I usually do on New Years, and it lasted a couple of weeks like it usually does - but about 3 weeks later, I got sick again. Same symptoms. Fast forward to February, about a month later, I’m sick again with the same symptoms. March, about a month later again - same symptoms. April, about 3 weeks later, I’m sick again with the same symptoms as always.\n\nIt was around this time that my mom and I noticed that nobody ever gets sick from me. I’m never, ever contagious - it almost seems like my body’s reaction to something rather than an illness. \n\nThis pattern continued for about a year, up until last New Years when I got sick again. I finally had enough and I decided to go to a walk in and explain my situation. I met a doctor who finally was willing to look into what this could be, rather than just marking it off as a cold or strep throat. He gave me some forms to get bloodwork done once when I was healthy, and again when I was sick. \n\nI waited until I was sick to get my bloodwork done, but, to my surprise, I didn’t get sick this year until about 9 months later. Come October, sure enough i was sick with the same symptoms as always. I got my bloodwork done while I was sick, and to my surprise all of my results came back normal EXCEPT - I had a CRP level of 49.9. I’m lucky enough to be dating and living with my girlfriend who is a Registered Nurse, and she explained to me that a high CRP level indicates some sort of swelling in the body, and could really be chalked up to anything.\n\nSo, when I was healthy, I went back to get my blood work done. After getting it done, I went back into the same walk in clinic and spoke with the doctor who was willing to look into what it could be.\n\nHe explained to me that my CRP had spiked to 49.9 while I was sick, and had fallen back down to 0.77 while I was healthy. He said that usually with something like a cold or the flu, you could expect to see CRP levels of 13 or so due to a cough or a sore throat causing some swelling - but he said because it spiked to high, he thinks we could be on the right track and it could be something else.\n\nOne thing we’re looking into is something called Periodic Fever Syndrome. This is usually (rarely) found in children, and typically doesn’t last until adulthood. Some adults however can even more rarely be diagnosed with this.\n\nWith all of that being said, that brings me to today. I was sick about a month ago, and surprise surprise I’m sick again. Last night my fever started out at around 37.9 when I noticed it, and I woke up about an hour and a half ago with a fever of 38.8 (Celsius of course). \n\nI’m going to wait a few days, and when whatever this is is at its peak, I’m going to get bloodwork again to see if my CRP spikes back up again.

{"thread_id": "t_gh5t8bn-0", "post": "Bit of a heavy one here, but I NEED advice.\n(Also sorry for the spelling and grammar I’m not the smartest when it comes to that stuff.)\n\nSo on the first of December I gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl. She weighed 6lbs 2oz and was the picture of health and happiness. Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because ‘that’s how babies are designed ‘ , but they didn’t see it , they didn’t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things.\nNevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn’t of helped her.\n\nFast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again . Finally she cried a few times and began to breath and even though she was foaming at the mouth and very weak I could tell she was atleast breathing again , this whole incident last 40 seconds. Once we got her breathing again we called an ambulance, they took her in to hospital and observed her for a while and advised on some changes in food (both the amount and type) and said she should be fine.\n\nNow here’s my problem, everyone said she was fine the first time too, but clearly it happened again and to a much worse degree! \nNow me and my partner are taking full shifts so she is always with someone who is awake and fully alert, which is fine but I can’t relax, I spent eight hours solidly just staring at her watching her breathing and panicking every time she moved or made a noise. I genuinely don’t know how I am meant to cope with this fear that she is going to die any second, I can’t enjoy any time with her because I’m so stressed even though I want to be able to enjoy being with her I just can’t over the past few days.

{"thread_id": "t_ghjzw0z-0", "post": "I'm a nurse in a group home for adults with severe multiple handicaps (Netherlands) and we are often not taken serious by doctors. For the past few days one of my residents (male, 66) has been very upset, hitting everyone who comes close to him (he only ever does this when he is very uncomfortable but it has been exteme and all our interventions do nothing, ie; painkillers, change of position, less stimuli or more). He has **bloating in his stomach**, it sounds hollow when you knock on his upper right part of his abdomen. Now keep in mind, this man's body is pretty malformed, we have no idea what his skeleton looks like or how his organs are situated. He has had sennosides, a lot of macrogol and received enemas every other day, his defecation pattern was normal (his **defecation is always water thin** because of laxatives and tube feedings). His **temperature wasn't high**  **(37,1 C/98,78 F).**\n\nTonight he was **extremely upset, feces came out of his J-tube** (he's had a J-tube for years and his intestine barely do anything anymore) and **out of his mouth.** We were sure he had an **ileus**. He was sent to the ER and was sent right back; CTscan didn't show any obstipation, his urine levels were normal and his lungs looked normal as well. They just sent him home... The doctor says he thinks it's a stomach virus.\n\nNow I'm pretty young, not very experienced, but what kind of stomach virus could ever have anyone fecal vomit? I absolutely do not believe this.\n\nAny help? Has anyone seen something as strange as this before?\n\nEdit: made improtant things bold + minor spelling corrections\n\nEdit 31/12/2020: This morning my colleagues called our doctor again for any help, since the hospital didn't provide us with anything else. The man had the audacity to prescribe **2x 500mg paractamol** and told us to **stop giving the resident Diclofenac because it would hurt his stomach more**... I cannot explain how angry I was. On top of that, he told us to only call him if the resident got a fever.\n\nSo my shift started, I discussed the situation with a fellow colleague who was equally as angry as I was (the resident was still extremely upset, hitting everything around him, quick surface breathing, we could easily see he was in pain. Family had arrived at that point and said the same. Once family says there;s something bad going on, it's in our best interest to absolutely believe them). We called the doctor again, after a few hours an assistant called back telling us the doctor prescribed **oxycodon** (5mg... but it's something to start with). He also allowed us to **decrease the tube feedings**; still the same speed, just 50% water 50% peptisorb. \nLater in the afternoon and evening he slept, slept and slept. He was calm, I guess. The whole day after him being admitted to hospital, there weren't any feces around his mouth or in his tube. Colleagues have pointed out that they would've recognized the smell of fecal vomiting, and because his feces are so thin, it could've been something else. But then again, the man takes in nothing but white/yellow peptisorb. The colour of the liquid could potentionally point to **nexium** (? he does take this but has never had this color show up) or **old blood**, which is still a massive problem. We weren't able to send him back to the ER since there was nothing accute going on anymore. The doctor didn't want to send him in again because he cannot say what's wrong... \n\n**Extra information that I had missed:** He wasn't being tube fed the first few hours in hospital and seemed to calm down because of that, hence the change in his feeding pattern, yet he was still angry. \nIn his medical history this has happened before, nothing was ever done but it always cleared up by itself after different tube feeding or antibiotics. \nHe also has a **hernia diagfragmatica**, **reflux oesophagus** and when he was a young boy he had **stomach bleeding.**\n\n**Thank you all for the comments and sweet words! I'm honestly at a loss of what to do and as many of you have said, only time will tell. I'm off for a few days now (not actually free, I also work at a different group, oops) so I can only hope he is still there after I come back. \nColleagues have pointed out that because his anatomy is so different, perhaps it indeed is just a stomach virus that made him have feces in places it definetely shouldn't be.

On top of that, he told us to only call him if the resident got a fever.\n\nSo my shift started, I discussed the situation with a fellow colleague who was equally as angry as I was (the resident was still extremely upset, hitting everything around him, quick surface breathing, we could easily see he was in pain.

The whole day after him being admitted to hospital, there weren't any feces around his mouth or in his tube. Colleagues have pointed out that they would've recognized the smell of fecal vomiting, and because his feces are so thin, it could've been something else. But then again, the man takes in nothing but white/yellow peptisorb. The colour of the liquid could potentionally point to **nexium** (? he does take this but has never had this color show up) or **old blood**, which is still a massive problem.

I am currently in a hospital bed on a Heparin Drip.  \n\nI have Vascular, Hematology, oncology, and even Gastro all stumped.  Basically, I am under attack by blood clots but no one has a clue why.   A year of this.  \n\nLong story short - calf DVT 10/20.  Found May Thurner, stent placed, clot resolved, moved on with life.   Taken off thinners. \n\nJuly - spinal surgery.  3 weeks later,  blood clots EVERYWHERE, spent a week in hospital had thrombectomy.  Simple answer - surgery caused clots (even though ive had many surgeries before with no clots).  Put on Xarelto. \n\nNovember - found more clots even on Xarelto.  Do tPA lysis catheter puts me in hospital another week.  Clears clogged stents, put on Lovenox.  \n\n2 weeks later - more clots.  Just had another thrombectomy.  \n\nI have tested negative for everything.  Negative for all genetic factors, negative for rare clotting disorders.

You should get your anticardiolipin antibodies checked again for antiphospholipid syndrome. But also consider a possible autoimmune reaction to the COVID vaccine. I know this is no one's favorite topic, however, COVID causes autoimmune complications, well known blood clotting disorders and cytokine storm reactions and the same systemic responses can be elicited by the vaccines, and have been. And could have triggered APS \\[antiphospholipid syndrome\\] response, so if you have a positive ANA, and even if you do not, get the ACL \\[anticardiolipid\\] antibodies checked again. \\[This is now redundant because the others have chimed in but I'll leave my vote in too.\\]\n\nYou may want to ask a rheumatologist to run through your chart. **Wegener's granulomatosis \\[an autoimmune disorder\\] comes to mind among other things, that specifically causes clots in the legs** when not caught in a timely manner. Here is the list of symptoms, note the leg clots complication halfway down the page, and they are also calling this \"Autoimmune **vasculitis\" although this is the first I've ever heard it called such:**\n\n[https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibodies-anca-test/](https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibodies-anca-test/)\n\n[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351088?p=1](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351088?p=1)\n\n**I am not a doctor, just a lawyer with lupus** who reads everything put in front of me. My nephew got sick two years ago with a mystery illness at 29 and died after 6 weeks of hospitalized illness of Guillain-Barre that was not diagnosed until the night before he died. Wegener's was something my own rheumatologist and I pressed them to test for at the time. Wegener's might fit, often autoimmune disorders are triggered by stressful events, including surgeries and also illness, or vaccinations. Your surgery could have triggered your initial flare of APS, or Wegener's. Or not.\n\n**Just keep getting tested repeatedly** for any of the autoimmune blood factors until you are definitively diagnosed with something that rules them in or out, because autoimmunity evolves, those antibodies continue to build and build while you develop them, if that is what you have, it takes time to trigger a positive result if it turns out to be autoimmune Wegener's or APS, or other, or COVID vaccine related.\n\n\\[Already said above by doctor, but\\] It is very important to note that \"lupus anticoagulant\" means absolutely nothing whatsoever to diagnosing actual lupus patients, it is not necessary. Nor does any of that other gobblety gook necessarily. You should just be concerned if you have a positive ANA or DS-DNA or with your symptoms IgM, IgG, IgA anticardiolipin antibodies given your symptoms, and also the whole \"lupus panel\" blood test, which are different tests than you got, plus I would ask a rheumatologist to **test for ANCA antibodies for Wegener's granulomatosis** and ask them to look for anything else based on your chart. That is my *unlearned opinion,* based on many years of pretty bad lupus with superficially uninteresting bloodwork.\n\n[https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibodies-anca-test/](https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibodies-anca-test/)\n\n**What is your CRP and your ESR? Not your CRP-hs but actual CRP?** Those measure your current level of systemic inflammation. Those are also called C-Reactive Protein, and Sed Rate. I think it is unlikely current autoimmune inflammation if one or the other is not elevated. Maybe this is posted above. I repeat, *I am a lawyer and not a doctor, don't take what I say as correct advice.* I have a bad habit of sounding authoritative out of my lane.\n\nAlso, sometimes a spinal tap will be more useful or a kidney biopsy to find hiding autoimmune issues.", "comment_is_question": false, "comment_is_response": true, "comment_respond_to": "ho2jn1i", "comment_requested_info": null, "comment_question_type": null, "comment_is_personal_experience": true, "comment_is_medical_knowledge": true, "comment_is_answered": null, "comment_is_relevant": true, "comment_score": 1, "comment_parent_id": "t1_ho2jn1i", "comment_turn_level": 4, "comment_author_flair_text": "Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.", "comment_created_utc": 1639297923, "qid": "t_ho26o8n-0-c4-q0", "question": "What is your CRP and your ESR?

{"thread_id": "t_hpttplp-0", "post": "Hello. My (24F) boyfriend, Paul (29M), and I are fairly active. We go on road trips every year with our main stops being prime hiking spots. Paul is 5'7'' and 230 pounds. Due to his southeast asian/pacific genetics, his entire family is on the heavier side, but Paul is just as active as I am and eats well.\n\nRecently, we have gone long distance. Paul returned to live with his parents due to the pandemic while I stayed where I was. I visited him in June 2021. At this point, Paul had few symptoms, but some new minor health issues. We went hiking around Lake Tahoe and Paul was a little more out of breath than usual. He hasn't needed to use his inhaler since he was a kid, and he had to use it on this trip. We attributed this to recent wildfires in the area and poor air quality.\n\nHowever, Paul's health continued to sharply deteriorate. We went to Edinburgh, Scotland, in July. While hiking Arthur's Seat, Paul had to use his inhaler so many times he emptied it out. He could not get it refilled as we were out of the country. Until the end of the trip, Paul's breathing became more and more labored and he developed a persistent cough.\n\nI did not visit Paul August-November 2021. We spoke on the phone and Skyped regularly. During this time, Paul would sometimes leave the call or mute for a few minutes. He'd come back and apologize, saying he'd had to cough pretty violently and didn't want me to hear. I was concerned. I overheard one wracking, moaning coughing session and knew it was not just asthma or an irritated throat. By October 2021, the air quality in his area had greatly improved.\n\nI persuaded Paul to visit his general practitioner. His GP dismissed all of his concerns and cited Paul's being fat and asthmatic as the source of his issues, and that the issues would disappear with rest and exercise. I had to fight doctors for years to get them to take my chronic pelvic pain seriously, and was finally diagnosed with an ovarian cyst that was 8mm long and about to burst, so I have experience with self advocacy in the medical space. I helped Paul see new doctors.\n\nIn mid-October 2021, Paul developed abdominal edema. Paul's feet, legs, and lower stomach were swelling up like crazy. He gained 40 pounds. He could barely move at all, even to go to the bathroom. He couldn't sleep lying down without suffocating, which only worsened his exhaustion. He went to the doctor again and was prescribed diuretics. The diuretics helped with the swelling and extra weight and within 2 weeks he was back to his regular weight, but the coughing and weakness persisted.\n\nAbout a month after regularly taking diuretics (November), Paul started feeling intense nausea on a weekly basis. This nausea would prompt coughing fits. Paul couldn't eat or focus while nauseated. Our calls became more and more infrequent as Paul's nausea and headaches grew. He told me sometimes the nausea would get so bad that he would vomit. There were no patterns to the vomiting--it didn't happen at a certain time of day or after meals. Sometimes it was foamy. He got a CT scan to look at his gall bladder and all results were within normal ranges. Blood tests, including labs for liver function, all came back normal. His doctor referred him to a gastroenterologist for more testing, but due to increases in COVID-19 cases, they haven't even processed his file, let alone scheduled appointments, which would be months out. A nurse anticipated he wouldn't be able to go in until February 2022, but at his rate of decline, this has me concerned for his mental wellbeing and life quality.\n\nThis week, in late December 2021, I visited him and his family for Christmas. I had heard from Paul about his issues and was following closely with his medical updates, but seeing it firsthand was another thing altogether. I have never seen human suffering and sickness like this up close or cared for another human being in such an intimate way.\n\nEvery single day, he has intense coughing fits and bouts of nausea where he makes vocalizations and gags, usually every few hours. At least once a day, these coughing fits are so bad that he spends 5-30 minutes vomiting in the sink. The vomiting has increased drastically. After this, the nausea alleviates, but Paul feels exhausted and has migraines. He barely eats. He barely sleeps.\n\nToday, he had three different nausea/coughing bouts that induced vomiting. One developed rapidly and he threw up in a restaurant bathroom. The last one, which just happened this evening as of writing this post, also caught him by surprise, and he vomited in the kitchen sink. The vomiting was so physically taxing that his nose bled profusely and he lost control of his bowels and peed himself. He was not strong enough to make it down the hall to the bathroom. Eventually, I assisted him into the shower. I am writing this before bed, and he is still coughing, and has a migraine. He hasn't gotten up from where he sat after taking the shower.\n\nI would appreciate any medical advice about what might be causing what Paul is going through, as well as tips for how to navigate the medical system to ensure this gets treated in the best way possible. I would like to reiterate that while neither of us are marathon running body builders, Paul (before all of this) was physically active and monitored his eating habits. He was also mentally active and had returned to school to pursue a degree in a new field. We both have families that are reasonably well off and are good support systems.\n\nPaul is one tough puppy, and reassures me that it \"isn't so bad,\" but after seeing it firsthand, I know this is not something that can continue the way it is. I am extremely worried, and caring for him is beginning to wear on me mentally. Sometimes I feel sympathy nausea when I hear the noises he makes in the bathroom.\n\nPlease help in any way possible. I appreciate any and every tip, and can provide additional information if needed. Thank you very much.\n\nUPDATE 12/26:\n\nWe went to the ER at 4 AM right after Christmas. Luckily, it was almost completely empty. I was not allowed to go back with him, so for the entire five hours I was sitting in the waiting room, I was only ever accompanied by one or two other people at a time.\n\nPaul's shortness of breath, fatigue, and wracking coughs got him seen quickly. He texted me updates as things progressed. He got every test I wrote down from these comments--BNP test, pulmonary work, chest x rays, GI work. An echocardigram is scheduled for next week.\n\nThey found out right away that Paul's BNP results were seven times higher than usual. They said this was indicative of heart failure. They also tested Paul for COVID 19. He tested negative, but did test indicating he had some kind of viral illness.\n\nPaul's doctor concluded that he was suffering from chronic RSV that was made worse by poor genetics, asthma, and obesity. Paul did confirm he had what felt like a respiratory illness in Scotland in June, then after going to a wedding in October, then this week when he got severely ill and we found out his mother had a cold.\n\nThere is no cure for RSV, but a vaccine has reached human trials. The only things Paul can do to alleviate his own suffering and avoid a heart attack is to make significant lifestyle changes and live like an immunocompromised person. I believe in his ability to achieve the former, but the latter is more difficult because of his emotionally overattached mother who brings the entire extended family out for lunches, movie nights, shopping, etc. several times a week. I'm concerned she won't take it seriously or will be in denial to avoid feeling responsible and will therefore continue to expose Paul to colds that could kill him.\n\nPaul is currently resting. He was given medication for his nausea and a new inhaler. He is doing better but still coughing. We have already started on his new food regimen. I am hoping for the best, but the pandemic has proved that people rarely take precautions for others' goodwill. Thank you for all your support.

{"thread_id": "t_hpttplp-0", "post": "Hello. My (24F) boyfriend, Paul (29M), and I are fairly active. We go on road trips every year with our main stops being prime hiking spots. Paul is 5'7'' and 230 pounds. Due to his southeast asian/pacific genetics, his entire family is on the heavier side, but Paul is just as active as I am and eats well.\n\nRecently, we have gone long distance. Paul returned to live with his parents due to the pandemic while I stayed where I was. I visited him in June 2021. At this point, Paul had few symptoms, but some new minor health issues. We went hiking around Lake Tahoe and Paul was a little more out of breath than usual. He hasn't needed to use his inhaler since he was a kid, and he had to use it on this trip. We attributed this to recent wildfires in the area and poor air quality.\n\nHowever, Paul's health continued to sharply deteriorate. We went to Edinburgh, Scotland, in July. While hiking Arthur's Seat, Paul had to use his inhaler so many times he emptied it out. He could not get it refilled as we were out of the country. Until the end of the trip, Paul's breathing became more and more labored and he developed a persistent cough.\n\nI did not visit Paul August-November 2021. We spoke on the phone and Skyped regularly. During this time, Paul would sometimes leave the call or mute for a few minutes. He'd come back and apologize, saying he'd had to cough pretty violently and didn't want me to hear. I was concerned. I overheard one wracking, moaning coughing session and knew it was not just asthma or an irritated throat. By October 2021, the air quality in his area had greatly improved.\n\nI persuaded Paul to visit his general practitioner. His GP dismissed all of his concerns and cited Paul's being fat and asthmatic as the source of his issues, and that the issues would disappear with rest and exercise. I had to fight doctors for years to get them to take my chronic pelvic pain seriously, and was finally diagnosed with an ovarian cyst that was 8mm long and about to burst, so I have experience with self advocacy in the medical space. I helped Paul see new doctors.\n\nIn mid-October 2021, Paul developed abdominal edema. Paul's feet, legs, and lower stomach were swelling up like crazy. He gained 40 pounds. He could barely move at all, even to go to the bathroom. He couldn't sleep lying down without suffocating, which only worsened his exhaustion. He went to the doctor again and was prescribed diuretics. The diuretics helped with the swelling and extra weight and within 2 weeks he was back to his regular weight, but the coughing and weakness persisted.\n\nAbout a month after regularly taking diuretics (November), Paul started feeling intense nausea on a weekly basis. This nausea would prompt coughing fits. Paul couldn't eat or focus while nauseated. Our calls became more and more infrequent as Paul's nausea and headaches grew. He told me sometimes the nausea would get so bad that he would vomit. There were no patterns to the vomiting--it didn't happen at a certain time of day or after meals. Sometimes it was foamy. He got a CT scan to look at his gall bladder and all results were within normal ranges. Blood tests, including labs for liver function, all came back normal. His doctor referred him to a gastroenterologist for more testing, but due to increases in COVID-19 cases, they haven't even processed his file, let alone scheduled appointments, which would be months out. A nurse anticipated he wouldn't be able to go in until February 2022, but at his rate of decline, this has me concerned for his mental wellbeing and life quality.\n\nThis week, in late December 2021, I visited him and his family for Christmas. I had heard from Paul about his issues and was following closely with his medical updates, but seeing it firsthand was another thing altogether. I have never seen human suffering and sickness like this up close or cared for another human being in such an intimate way.\n\nEvery single day, he has intense coughing fits and bouts of nausea where he makes vocalizations and gags, usually every few hours. At least once a day, these coughing fits are so bad that he spends 5-30 minutes vomiting in the sink. The vomiting has increased drastically. After this, the nausea alleviates, but Paul feels exhausted and has migraines. He barely eats. He barely sleeps.\n\nToday, he had three different nausea/coughing bouts that induced vomiting. One developed rapidly and he threw up in a restaurant bathroom. The last one, which just happened this evening as of writing this post, also caught him by surprise, and he vomited in the kitchen sink. The vomiting was so physically taxing that his nose bled profusely and he lost control of his bowels and peed himself. He was not strong enough to make it down the hall to the bathroom. Eventually, I assisted him into the shower. I am writing this before bed, and he is still coughing, and has a migraine. He hasn't gotten up from where he sat after taking the shower.\n\nI would appreciate any medical advice about what might be causing what Paul is going through, as well as tips for how to navigate the medical system to ensure this gets treated in the best way possible. I would like to reiterate that while neither of us are marathon running body builders, Paul (before all of this) was physically active and monitored his eating habits. He was also mentally active and had returned to school to pursue a degree in a new field. We both have families that are reasonably well off and are good support systems.\n\nPaul is one tough puppy, and reassures me that it \"isn't so bad,\" but after seeing it firsthand, I know this is not something that can continue the way it is. I am extremely worried, and caring for him is beginning to wear on me mentally. Sometimes I feel sympathy nausea when I hear the noises he makes in the bathroom.\n\nPlease help in any way possible. I appreciate any and every tip, and can provide additional information if needed. Thank you very much.\n\nUPDATE 12/26:\n\nWe went to the ER at 4 AM right after Christmas. Luckily, it was almost completely empty. I was not allowed to go back with him, so for the entire five hours I was sitting in the waiting room, I was only ever accompanied by one or two other people at a time.\n\nPaul's shortness of breath, fatigue, and wracking coughs got him seen quickly.

The only things Paul can do to alleviate his own suffering and avoid a heart attack is to make significant lifestyle changes and live like an immunocompromised person.

{"thread_id": "t_hpttplp-1", "post": "Hello. My (24F) boyfriend, Paul (29M), and I are fairly active. We go on road trips every year with our main stops being prime hiking spots. Paul is 5'7'' and 230 pounds. Due to his southeast asian/pacific genetics, his entire family is on the heavier side, but Paul is just as active as I am and eats well.\n\nRecently, we have gone long distance. Paul returned to live with his parents due to the pandemic while I stayed where I was. I visited him in June 2021. At this point, Paul had few symptoms, but some new minor health issues. We went hiking around Lake Tahoe and Paul was a little more out of breath than usual. He hasn't needed to use his inhaler since he was a kid, and he had to use it on this trip. We attributed this to recent wildfires in the area and poor air quality.\n\nHowever, Paul's health continued to sharply deteriorate. We went to Edinburgh, Scotland, in July. While hiking Arthur's Seat, Paul had to use his inhaler so many times he emptied it out. He could not get it refilled as we were out of the country. Until the end of the trip, Paul's breathing became more and more labored and he developed a persistent cough.\n\nI did not visit Paul August-November 2021. We spoke on the phone and Skyped regularly. During this time, Paul would sometimes leave the call or mute for a few minutes. He'd come back and apologize, saying he'd had to cough pretty violently and didn't want me to hear. I was concerned. I overheard one wracking, moaning coughing session and knew it was not just asthma or an irritated throat. By October 2021, the air quality in his area had greatly improved.\n\nI persuaded Paul to visit his general practitioner. His GP dismissed all of his concerns and cited Paul's being fat and asthmatic as the source of his issues, and that the issues would disappear with rest and exercise. I had to fight doctors for years to get them to take my chronic pelvic pain seriously, and was finally diagnosed with an ovarian cyst that was 8mm long and about to burst, so I have experience with self advocacy in the medical space. I helped Paul see new doctors.\n\nIn mid-October 2021, Paul developed abdominal edema. Paul's feet, legs, and lower stomach were swelling up like crazy. He gained 40 pounds. He could barely move at all, even to go to the bathroom. He couldn't sleep lying down without suffocating, which only worsened his exhaustion. He went to the doctor again and was prescribed diuretics. The diuretics helped with the swelling and extra weight and within 2 weeks he was back to his regular weight, but the coughing and weakness persisted.\n\nAbout a month after regularly taking diuretics (November), Paul started feeling intense nausea on a weekly basis. This nausea would prompt coughing fits. Paul couldn't eat or focus while nauseated. Our calls became more and more infrequent as Paul's nausea and headaches grew. He told me sometimes the nausea would get so bad that he would vomit. There were no patterns to the vomiting--it didn't happen at a certain time of day or after meals. Sometimes it was foamy. He got a CT scan to look at his gall bladder and all results were within normal ranges. Blood tests, including labs for liver function, all came back normal. His doctor referred him to a gastroenterologist for more testing, but due to increases in COVID-19 cases, they haven't even processed his file, let alone scheduled appointments, which would be months out. A nurse anticipated he wouldn't be able to go in until February 2022, but at his rate of decline, this has me concerned for his mental wellbeing and life quality.\n\nThis week, in late December 2021, I visited him and his family for Christmas. I had heard from Paul about his issues and was following closely with his medical updates, but seeing it firsthand was another thing altogether. I have never seen human suffering and sickness like this up close or cared for another human being in such an intimate way.\n\nEvery single day, he has intense coughing fits and bouts of nausea where he makes vocalizations and gags, usually every few hours. At least once a day, these coughing fits are so bad that he spends 5-30 minutes vomiting in the sink. The vomiting has increased drastically. After this, the nausea alleviates, but Paul feels exhausted and has migraines. He barely eats. He barely sleeps.\n\nToday, he had three different nausea/coughing bouts that induced vomiting. One developed rapidly and he threw up in a restaurant bathroom. The last one, which just happened this evening as of writing this post, also caught him by surprise, and he vomited in the kitchen sink. The vomiting was so physically taxing that his nose bled profusely and he lost control of his bowels and peed himself. He was not strong enough to make it down the hall to the bathroom. Eventually, I assisted him into the shower. I am writing this before bed, and he is still coughing, and has a migraine. He hasn't gotten up from where he sat after taking the shower.\n\nI would appreciate any medical advice about what might be causing what Paul is going through, as well as tips for how to navigate the medical system to ensure this gets treated in the best way possible.

{"thread_id": "t_izpfojt-0", "post": "Male. 25 years old. 170 pounds.\nI was diagnosed with Flu A on Tueaday . Yesterday with an ear infection.

It doesn't feel like a throb just like a stretching pain that's usually just above my back but sometimes right on my back. My temp is hovering around 99 to 99.5.  Nose is drippy a bit. My feet are getting cold and clammy. My HR is a little high. I do have a moderate headache. It's worse than a normal headache but I've had worse.

Got the fever down but the next day my wife and I noticed she started going cross eyed on and off. We called our pediatrician and set up an appointment in 2 weeks. She has never gone cross eyed before in her life for any sort of extended amount of time. Now it’s happening frequently. The nurse on the phone said those 2 things (fever and crossed eyes) doing coincide at all, and somewhat insinuated that maybe we just didn’t notice it before. I am without a doubt 100% sure we would have noticed how cross eyed she is going over the course of the past two years. I understand these may not be totally related, but could the fever have brought to light some sort of other issue? Or any information on what could potentially be going on would be appreciated.\n\nEdit:\nTo those saying I’m a bad parent, we took the advice of our pediatricians office which we had no reason to doubt. \n\nWe did take her to the ER. Since she no longer has the fever, and the eyes crossing is intermittent (daughter didn’t have the crossed eyes while in the ER) they are saying it’s most likely unrelated and gave us a referral to the children’s eye doctor.

I took two sips in total from the drink but I didn't swallow it, instead spitting it out and throwing the drink out. \n\nIt smelled fine but tasted a bit off.

The \"swelling\" sensation causes her to start to gag, and after she gags, she will start to choke and is unable to breathe. While she is having one of these episodes, she can sometimes get a gasping breath (Remember that episode of Game of Thrones where Theon was running away from Ramsay and he got knocked off his horse and got the wind knocked out of him, and he did that horrible gasping breath? That's exactly what it sounds like.)

She has seen doctors for everything, biopsies, X-rays, cameras down her throat, everything. They have been unable to find anything.

From what I've read, having an HDL/TRIG ratio of below 2 is very good?\n\nI was hoping my HDL would be higher due to lifting weights and biking.. shafted on that as well.\n\nAlso, I thought total cholesterol was LDL + HDL + 1/5th of your Trig?\n\nThis is pretty depressing.. the nurse called me with the results, all she read over the phone was the 255 LDL and then said the doctor recommends starting Lipitor immediately. I said I wasn't sure and wanted to think about. The nurse called back 30 mins later to reiterate how important it is that I start a statin immediately and how high of a risk I'm currently at for heart attack/heart disease. It's just hard to hear at 30 years old, 6' 180 pounds, in good shape and extremely thoughtful about what I eat.\n\n Obviously I need to do something, I'm not in denial, this isn't healthy, and like she said, no amount of exercise or healthy eating (already do both) is going to change it. I'm just afraid of taking the plunge into statins.. but it seems inevitable ?\n\n\nOf course I've read about read yeast rice, niacin, plant stanols/sterols, etc etc. From what I understand, the most effective - RYR, is very similar to statins in that it's the same compound that works, only at an unknown amount in the RYR? \n\n\nWhat does this other stuff (the non cholesterol stuff) mean to me?

I looked at my throat and saw white spots. Naturally, I thought, “CRAP, strep!”.  Just so happens I was with someone who second guessed me and took a look for himself. He told me he’d had this issue and that it was tonsil stones. We proceeded to extract not one but NINE motherlovin’ nasty ass stones from my tonsils.

Needless to say, I’m thoroughly grossed/freaked out. Hopefully I can now justify having my tonsils removed. Would this be enough to justify a tonsillectomy?

It seems to slightly get better throughout the day, but after a nights sleep (on my back) all the pain comes back with full force; so much that it literally takes me 5 min to slowly get the courage to get out of bed because that is one of the worst moments thb. No visible signs of injury afaik.\n\nI went to my emergency center (in Sweden, närakute) and the doctor only listened to my breathing, to see if my lungs were punctured, and then prescribed me some anti inflammatory (idk the name but she said twice a day with food). I just checked her notes online and all she wrote was: \"Contusion on the chest\". \n\n\nObviously I'm not a doctor or anything else, but shouldn't I actually get a fucking xray at the very least or something? I mean maybe if something else is punctured or bleeding, then I'd actually be dead by now from internal bleeding, but still, how can this hurt so much without something being broken?", "title": "Broke fall while snowboarding with only my chest", "author_post": "SwagAntiswag", "id_post": "kjc7j1", "post_author_feedback": false, "pos_post_author_feedback": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "total_score": 2, "verified_author_flairs": [], "unique_author_counts": 2, "year": 2020, "created_utc": 1608800566, "has_conclusion": 1, "refer_to_hospital": 0.0, "prev_additional_contexts": [], "comment_id": "gh20bh4", "comment_author": "saucydyllpickle", "comment_body": "I agree with what you said.
