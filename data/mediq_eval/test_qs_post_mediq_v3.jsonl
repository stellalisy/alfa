That's PART of it. No my decision is also for the child's sake and mine. A small example: Part of my joint issues is lack of feeling and lots of weakness in my hands. I drop ballpoint pens. I drop books. I drop lots of things. I guarantee that at some point I would drop a baby. I don't want to kill baby(s). That's why I refuse to hold other people's babies. That's why I definitely don't need my own. Pregnancy is a perfectly rational fear. I've learned of enough complications as well how a regular one works to know its not irrational to want to avoid it.

Also its despite the problem I have of too much natural lubricant. Also Maybe condoms aren't effective enough to rely on them and they fail too easily? Or are too expensive to use with a long term partner (I'm planning to be married at some point.)

Existing conditions are asthma, allergies, GERD, depression and anxiety disorder. No change in diet.\nOk, now on to my \"mystery illness\". I'll try to give as much detail as possible. Three weeks ago, I noticed the tops of my feet hurt while walking or bending/flexing my feet. The next day the tops of my hands. A day or two later my ankles and wrists joined. I had no swelling that week until a party that weekend. I was standing a lot and took my shoe off because my right foot felt tight and saw that my foot was very swollen and very painful. Swollen from the ankle down to my toes. The next day, still swollen and barely able to walk on it, I promised my husband I'd go to the family doctor. \nBy the time I could see the doctor, 3 days later, my left wrist and top of my hand was swollen as well. I also started to have pain in my right leg. It was up my leg to my knee. But this was more in the muscles of my leg and the area behind my knee I call my \"knee pit\". I can't bend my wrists, right knee or ankles barely at all. The doctor said she really wasn't sure what to think. I had blood drawn for the typical lab panel as well as one for lyme disease. I told her how much pain I was in. I can barely wash and dry my hair, cook, clean house or work at this point (I use my hands a lot at work for various tedious tasks). I can't even hook my own bra behind my back. I feel pathetic and helpless. She recommend that I use OTC pain relievers. I already knew these haven't helped, but had hopes of getting an answer from the blood tests if wait it out.\nAll of my blood work came back normal, I'm really healthy on paper. At this point I'm very frustrated. She recommended I see a rheumatologist and because of my pleading for relief from this extreme pain, gave me a prescription for tramadol. Later on in the week, I had to call and request something else, tramadol didn't even touch the pain. I feel like they think I'm just asking for random pain killers, they make feel like I'm doing something wrong. But, they prescribed mobic anyway. Still not even worth me taking it. Might as well be a pez candy for all it does. The last few days, a couple fingers have started hurting as well. \nNow, the best way I can describe these pains is comparing it to a sprained wrist/twisted ankle/jammed finger. There is extreme pain when I trip over my dog or bend my wrist while pushing off from my chair to stand. These pains are intense and sharp. Heat or cold packs don't help much, but I've used them on the main swollen areas just for temporary relief.\nI have no history of arthritis or autoimmune disorders in my family. All of my family is really healthy and they think I'm exaggerating. My rheumatoid factor on the lab work was &lt;10 with the cutoff at &lt;=14. \nI can say that I've been under *extreme* stress for months.

Perhaps 3T?).\n\nRight after the exam I asked the doctor if he saw anything, he said it was all clear. \n\nIs there a chance they could've missed a brain tumor since there was no contrast? I know that a contrast MRI is like 99% definitive, but is a noncontrast close? \n\nAlso, if the MRI missed a small tumor for not having contrast, wouldn't it have to be small enough, therefore not causing any of these symptoms?

Problems Causing Misery :(\n\nHey guys!  Thanks in advance for looking this over, and I apologize for it being so long but I'm really trying to be thorough.  I'm a 27-year-old caucasian female from south FL, approximately 5'2\" and currently 140 lbs.  For the past month and a half I've been experiencing terrible, debilitating nausea and abdominal discomfort.  I also have NO appetite -- just the thought of eating makes me feel nauseous.  When I do try to eat I can only ever manage a few bites before I feel uncomfortably full.  \n\nThe situation escalated to the point where I lost about 8 lbs in a week and a half (went from 150-142) and I finally went to see a GI in mid-October. They performed an ultrasound of my gallbladder (clean!) and also did some blood work, which also came back clean.  The GI prescribed me 10mg dicyclomine to be taken 3 times a day, as well as a week long course of ciprofloxacin.  I responded well to the dicyclomine at first -- my first two days on the pills I felt almost normal.  But it started to have some diminishing returns pretty quickly, so I spoke with my GI and decided to take it four times a day.  Once again, I'm experiencing some diminishing returns and I am now taking dicyclomine five times a day.  He also recommended I take 20g omeprazole twice a day, which I have been doing for several weeks.  I saw him for a followup on Weds and explained I was still experiencing nausea and difficulty eating, so he's now added a probiotic (Align, taken I believe once daily?  I haven't started yet, I ordered the pills online and they should be arriving today) and he suggested taking a Tums before bedtime (which I have done for the last few days, using \"ultra strength\" Tums.)\n\nLike I said, the medication seemed to work at first.  I went from 142 to 144-46, and I was starting to function almost normally.  I still couldn't eat a lot but the nausea seemed to be resolved by the medication.  After a week I had to increase the dosage but it still mostly resolved my nausea.  Things are looking kind of bleak lately though.  I took my morning dose of omeprazole and dicyclomine about two hours ago and I'm still feeling nauseous, although a bit better than I did this morning.  The nausea is bad enough right now that I don't feel like I could function comfortably outside of my apartment.  I'm also starting to lose weight again (which yay, I guess, but I really wanted to get there through proper diet and exercise, not because I can't eat food.)\n\nSome more relevant information: I experienced a similar situation back in March/April where I felt nauseous and unable to eat.  This lasted about 3-4 weeks, and was not nearly as serious as the nausea I experience now.  I just stuck to a diet of simple chicken broth and saltines until my stomach settled, which it eventually did.  I didn't see a doctor for that.  I had also been losing weight intentionally prior to my stomach issues, approximately 25 lbs before these shenanigans began. Back in June I experienced SEVERE, sharp abdominal pain that lasted for about 4-5 days.  I saw the GI back then as well and he said it was likely a gallbladder attack from the weight loss and he gave me a prescription, but by that point I was actually getting better on my own and didn't end up taking the medication.  Eventually the pain went away completely and I was totally fine pretty much until October when this whole mess started.\n\nSince this is a GI problem I should probably discuss my bowel movements.  Mostly it's been kind of inconsistent, probably because of how wildly my eating habits vary lately.  Some mornings I'll produce several large, soft BMs, other days it's almost nothing all day -- small, hard BMs.  Lately it's been almost nothing, I suspect because I'm having so much trouble eating.  But who knows?  Urine seems to be pretty normal, at least to me.  \n\nThe nausea is basically constant but I've only thrown up once this whole time back in October, and what I threw up was literally just a pill and water.  (There was nothing else in my system.)  I feel like if I pushed myself to eat more it would probably end up making me vomit, but I haven't really wanted to try that yet.  Also, the nausea seems to come in waves: it's always present, but sometimes it just gets SO MUCH WORSE before ebbing back to a lower level.  Aside from the nausea I get occasional stomach discomfort (not pain, more like a terrible gnawing sensation, it might just be hunger at this point honestly), fatigue (might be hunger or the dicyclomine), and rarely I get chills (again, probably hunger).  Also, when I went to the GI on Weds it took them a LONG time to get a blood pressure reading for me.  Multiple attempts on each arm, until finally the fifth time the nurse wrapped the sleeve around my forearm and managed to get a reading.  I don't recall what it was but the nurse didn't comment on it, so I'm assuming it was within normal range.  She said the difficulty getting a reading on my blood pressure was probably due to dehydration.  It's pretty difficult for me to swallow liquids without nausea at this point, so it makes sense.  I'm gonna try sipping on some Gatorade today to see if it'll help me be a little less dehydrated.\n\nFull disclosure: before my stomach started misbehaving I vaporized marijuana recreationally, anywhere from .1g to .5g a day.  I used to partake rarely back when I was in California, primarily by using edibles.  I stopped for 6 months after moving from California to a fully illegal state and only resumed usage back in early August.  All told I've probably enjoyed weed for a total of about a little over a year, but only since August did I become a daily user. Vaporizing the larger amounts (like .5g/day) is also a fairly recent development that I started in RESPONSE to my nausea, I was definitely using smaller amounts when this all started.  I'm mentioning this because I have heard of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, and while I'm fairly certain I don't have CHS I figure it's worth throwing out there as an option.  I will say that I just took a hot shower that seemed to relieve my symptoms temporarily, but again I almost never vomit (which I understand is a hallmark symptom of CHS and CVS) so it just doesn't seem very likely.  I'm abstaining from marijuana for the next few days just to be sure, but I have to say that it is difficult because marijuana is about the only thing that seems to reliably alleviate my symptoms.  It's also the only way I can manage to eat more than two bites of something without wanting to puke it all back up.  On that note, if cannabis isn't the cause of my symptoms is it still safe for me to use it to treat my nausea?  (Yes, I understand \"safe\" is kind of a relative term when you're getting it from a dealer rather than a medical dispensary, but I do trust my guy and nobody else appears to be getting sick from his product.)  I understand that marijuana can slow gut motility, and if my issue is related to gastroparesis then I definitely don't want to exacerbate the problem, you know?  I have not yet disclosed my marijuana usage to my GI (he hasn't asked yet and he's a friend of the family, so I can't help but feel a little paranoid that he'd tell my folks) but if it is relevant I will obviously do so.\n\nExtra relevancy in case anyone thinks it might be IBS: I menstruated this week and it didn't really seem to effect my symptoms, either for better or for worse, but as my period tapered off the nausea started to get really bad.  Other than that it was a pretty normal period.  Not sure if it's relevant, but I know IBS symptoms can worsen during menstruation.   \n\nAnd I think that's about it?  To me the current possibilities seem like it might be IBS, Crohn's, gastroparesis...  But I'm not a doctor, thank god!  My GI thinks it's either my gallbladder or a particularly nasty virus -- he said some might cause symptoms for up to six months, so I guess it's possible!  But I'd love to hear any feedback you guys might have.  I have another followup with my GI scheduled for December but if the nausea continues like this and abstaining from marijuana doesn't resolve the issue then I might bump that up a couple of weeks.  It's really, really hard to live like this.  Right now the dicyclomine helps a little but it's just not enough anymore.

I'm a 27-year-old caucasian female from south FL, approximately 5'2\" and currently 140 lbs.  For the past month and a half I've been experiencing terrible, debilitating nausea and abdominal discomfort.  I also have NO appetite -- just the thought of eating makes me feel nauseous.  When I do try to eat I can only ever manage a few bites before I feel uncomfortably full.  \n\nThe situation escalated to the point where I lost about 8 lbs in a week and a half (went from 150-142) and I finally went to see a GI in mid-October. They performed an ultrasound of my gallbladder (clean!) and also did some blood work, which also came back clean.  The GI prescribed me 10mg dicyclomine to be taken 3 times a day, as well as a week long course of ciprofloxacin.  I responded well to the dicyclomine at first -- my first two days on the pills I felt almost normal.  But it started to have some diminishing returns pretty quickly, so I spoke with my GI and decided to take it four times a day.  Once again, I'm experiencing some diminishing returns and I am now taking dicyclomine five times a day.  He also recommended I take 20g omeprazole twice a day, which I have been doing for several weeks.  I saw him for a followup on Weds and explained I was still experiencing nausea and difficulty eating, so he's now added a probiotic (Align, taken I believe once daily?  I haven't started yet, I ordered the pills online and they should be arriving today) and he suggested taking a Tums before bedtime (which I have done for the last few days, using \"ultra strength\" Tums.)\n\nLike I said, the medication seemed to work at first.  I went from 142 to 144-46, and I was starting to function almost normally.  I still couldn't eat a lot but the nausea seemed to be resolved by the medication.  After a week I had to increase the dosage but it still mostly resolved my nausea.  Things are looking kind of bleak lately though.  I took my morning dose of omeprazole and dicyclomine about two hours ago and I'm still feeling nauseous, although a bit better than I did this morning.  The nausea is bad enough right now that I don't feel like I could function comfortably outside of my apartment.  I'm also starting to lose weight again (which yay, I guess, but I really wanted to get there through proper diet and exercise, not because I can't eat food.)\n\nSome more relevant information: I experienced a similar situation back in March/April where I felt nauseous and unable to eat.  This lasted about 3-4 weeks, and was not nearly as serious as the nausea I experience now.  I just stuck to a diet of simple chicken broth and saltines until my stomach settled, which it eventually did.  I didn't see a doctor for that.  I had also been losing weight intentionally prior to my stomach issues, approximately 25 lbs before these shenanigans began. Back in June I experienced SEVERE, sharp abdominal pain that lasted for about 4-5 days.  I saw the GI back then as well and he said it was likely a gallbladder attack from the weight loss and he gave me a prescription, but by that point I was actually getting better on my own and didn't end up taking the medication.  Eventually the pain went away completely and I was totally fine pretty much until October when this whole mess started.\n\nSince this is a GI problem I should probably discuss my bowel movements.  Mostly it's been kind of inconsistent, probably because of how wildly my eating habits vary lately.  Some mornings I'll produce several large, soft BMs, other days it's almost nothing all day -- small, hard BMs.  Lately it's been almost nothing, I suspect because I'm having so much trouble eating.  But who knows?  Urine seems to be pretty normal, at least to me.  \n\nThe nausea is basically constant but I've only thrown up once this whole time back in October, and what I threw up was literally just a pill and water.  (There was nothing else in my system.)  I feel like if I pushed myself to eat more it would probably end up making me vomit, but I haven't really wanted to try that yet.  Also, the nausea seems to come in waves: it's always present, but sometimes it just gets SO MUCH WORSE before ebbing back to a lower level.  Aside from the nausea I get occasional stomach discomfort (not pain, more like a terrible gnawing sensation, it might just be hunger at this point honestly), fatigue (might be hunger or the dicyclomine), and rarely I get chills (again, probably hunger).  Also, when I went to the GI on Weds it took them a LONG time to get a blood pressure reading for me.  Multiple attempts on each arm, until finally the fifth time the nurse wrapped the sleeve around my forearm and managed to get a reading.  I don't recall what it was but the nurse didn't comment on it, so I'm assuming it was within normal range.  She said the difficulty getting a reading on my blood pressure was probably due to dehydration.  It's pretty difficult for me to swallow liquids without nausea at this point, so it makes sense.  I'm gonna try sipping on some Gatorade today to see if it'll help me be a little less dehydrated.\n\nFull disclosure: before my stomach started misbehaving I vaporized marijuana recreationally, anywhere from .1g to .5g a day.  I used to partake rarely back when I was in California, primarily by using edibles.  I stopped for 6 months after moving from California to a fully illegal state and only resumed usage back in early August.  All told I've probably enjoyed weed for a total of about a little over a year, but only since August did I become a daily user. Vaporizing the larger amounts (like .5g/day) is also a fairly recent development that I started in RESPONSE to my nausea, I was definitely using smaller amounts when this all started.  I'm mentioning this because I have heard of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, and while I'm fairly certain I don't have CHS I figure it's worth throwing out there as an option.  I will say that I just took a hot shower that seemed to relieve my symptoms temporarily, but again I almost never vomit (which I understand is a hallmark symptom of CHS and CVS) so it just doesn't seem very likely.  I'm abstaining from marijuana for the next few days just to be sure, but I have to say that it is difficult because marijuana is about the only thing that seems to reliably alleviate my symptoms.  It's also the only way I can manage to eat more than two bites of something without wanting to puke it all back up.  On that note, if cannabis isn't the cause of my symptoms is it still safe for me to use it to treat my nausea?  (Yes, I understand \"safe\" is kind of a relative term when you're getting it from a dealer rather than a medical dispensary, but I do trust my guy and nobody else appears to be getting sick from his product.)  I understand that marijuana can slow gut motility, and if my issue is related to gastroparesis then I definitely don't want to exacerbate the problem, you know?  I have not yet disclosed my marijuana usage to my GI (he hasn't asked yet and he's a friend of the family, so I can't help but feel a little paranoid that he'd tell my folks) but if it is relevant I will obviously do so.\n\nExtra relevancy in case anyone thinks it might be IBS: I menstruated this week and it didn't really seem to effect my symptoms, either for better or for worse, but as my period tapered off the nausea started to get really bad.  Other than that it was a pretty normal period.  Not sure if it's relevant, but I know IBS symptoms can worsen during menstruation.   \n\nAnd I think that's about it?  To me the current possibilities seem like it might be IBS, Crohn's, gastroparesis...  But I'm not a doctor, thank god!  My GI thinks it's either my gallbladder or a particularly nasty virus -- he said some might cause symptoms for up to six months, so I guess it's possible!  But I'd love to hear any feedback you guys might have.  I have another followup with my GI scheduled for December but if the nausea continues like this and abstaining from marijuana doesn't resolve the issue then I might bump that up a couple of weeks.  It's really, really hard to live like this.  Right now the dicyclomine helps a little but it's just not enough anymore.

The night before I had somewhere between 2 and 4 ounces of a fairly low ABV beer.\n\nI spoke to my doctor who seemed concerned and asked that I abstain from drinking for 2 - 3 weeks and retake these tests but didn't really give me an idea of how \"bad\" these results were, whether they're indicative of significant liver damage, etc. He did state that over my last 3 tests my platelets have been dropping somewhat (119 a little over a year ago, a bit higher but still \"low\" before that).\n\nIn the interest of me not spending the next 3 weeks freaking out about the unknown, are these numbers enough to say anything at all or do i just need to wait and see what the next test says?"}

I don't know if they're true hallucinations since I know they aren't real, but yeah.\n\nDoctor Question: Do you experience sleep paralysis?\nPatient Response: No sleep paralysis.\n\nDoctor Question: Do you sleep through the night or do you have frequent awakenings?\nPatient Response: I have had nights where I woke up every 40 or so minutes, but it doesn't happen every night.\n\nDoctor Question: What's your sleep schedule like?\nPatient Response: My sleep schedule is terrible. I deal with frequent bouts of insomnia where I can't fall asleep until I'm completely exhausted, and even then sometimes I still can't fall asleep. I've gone days without sleeping where nothing, including taking multiple doses of benadryl and melatonin, worked.", "initial_info": "\u201cI\u2019ve been having a sharp, intermittent pain in my lower right abdomen for the past three days that worsens when I move.\u201d", "original_post": "Could I have a CSF-related problem? If so, how do I convince drs to check me for one?\n\nI have struggled with several debilitating health issues for the past about 10 years but have been to many doctors with no answers. The hardest to deal with are the cognitive problems. It is so stressful just to carry out conversations because I can't remember words and often have trouble putting my thoughts into sentence form even when I can remember the words. It results in a lot of awkward pauses when I'm trying to speak and a lot of people getting impatient and finishing my sentences for me. I also have a very hard time reading now. It takes me like 8 hours to read 20 pages of a book because I have to keep re-reading what I read, not to mention going back to re-read sections because I can't remember which character is which and what has happened so far. A similar thing happens with trying to concentrate while watching movies. There are so many simple tasks like driving or even just putting away my groceries sometimes that are difficult because I get confused doing them. At night time when I'm tired, I have hallucinations sometimes. \n\n\nAside from the hallucinations, other problems I have are on and off numbness, almost constant headaches, episodes of vertigo, neck stiffness, very frequent urination (like every 15 minutes), sensitivity to lights, sounds, and smells, and off and on muffled hearing.\n \n\nI'm sure I'm forgetting some symptoms, but my point is that when I go down a list of problems that can be caused by CSF leaks or other CSF problems, I find myself going, \"Yep, yep, yep, yep,\" but a doctor has never once brought CSF up. I've had MRIs to check for MS or structural brain problems, various blood tests, and balance testing. All of that came back normal. \n\n\nI don't want to  be one of those annoying patients who diagnose themselves on the internet. I just want to not live like this anymore. It's pure torture, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. The past few weeks, the brain fog and headaches have been BAD, so I'm thinking about calling Monday and seeing if I can go back to the neurologist. (I think it might have all been made worse by going on a roller coaster, but that's just a guess). I just imagine he'll do the same thing he always does and say it's all anxiety/depression (I can't go to another neurologist because of my insurance, but I have seen others in the past, and they've all done the same thing more or less). Is it possible this is a CSF problem? Is it even worth bringing it up, or is it so unlikely that I'll just be brushed off in seconds?\n\n\nI'm 28, female, 5'0\", 124 lbs, caucasian, and in the USA. I don't take any medications regularly. I occasionally take an Imitrex when the headache and migraine-ish symptoms get really bad, though I don't really know why because it doesn't help much if any. \n\n\nI am sorry this is so scatter-brained. I hope it makes enough sense."}

I'm assuming this will also go away in 1-2 days, but I'm wondering if anyone here knows what this could be?\n\nOf course, I will immediately go to a doctor if my symptoms get worse. But right now, I'm not in excruciating pain, and given my history with this, it's likely to go away in under 48 hours.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!"}

Most people find out they have POTS. Basically they hooked me up to a table with leads going all over my body and heads and tested my blood pressure and an ECG at the same time. Some hospitals just do a test where the sit you up with an ECG, I had done that before and a cardiologist looked at it very quickly (since I\u2019m only 26 and everyone writes me off as being healthy/having anxiety) so finally I seen the chief neurologist at the best Boston hospital and he took me serious and did a great tilt table test WITH a biopsy and I feel so relieved that I\u2019m not crazy!

With that out of the way, six days ago I went to the mall to see Christmas decorations and to look for presents for my younger cousins. Now, I don\u2019t go out much, and I also have a phobia of germs. As a result, for the past four to five years, I usually only get sick once a year, if at all. The reason I\u2019m bringing this up is because I thought it worth noting that perhaps my immune system isn\u2019t very strong. I don\u2019t know whether or not this is relevant, but I thought it worth noting based on the title of the thread. Anyways, since my cousins are eight and five, I went into a lot of toy stores. I bring this up because kids are nasty. By that, I mean they are always exposed to illnesses and don\u2019t wash their hands before touching things. I don\u2019t hate kids! It\u2019s worth noting  I hadn\u2019t yet gotten my flu shot, but I wasn\u2019t all that concerned, as when I\u2019m in public, I keep my hands away from my face when they aren\u2019t clean, always wash my hands before I eat anything, and even open doors with my shirt covering my hand.\nI left after a few hours. The following evening, my throat was ever so slightly sore. That\u2019s a big red flag for me, but I went to bed and hoped it wasn\u2019t going to be brutal. I woke up the next morning with a hellish pain in my throat. It hurt to swallow. It hurt to drink. It hurt. Period. My ears were popping and aching as well. I went to assess the damage and noticed white blotches behind my uvula, which seemed off. After a few hours and two Ibuprofen, the throat pain was pretty minimal, though my ears were still popping. Later that evening, I developed a cough, which only got worse as the night went on. All this combined with me coughing up phlegm, I decided to go to a walk in clinic the following day if I remained this way. I woke up in the morning, and I actually felt quite a bit better. I was still coughing up phlegm, and my cough was now a constant symptom, but my throat felt pretty okay. Nonetheless, I went to the clinic that evening. I explained my symptoms, and requested a strep test, which they obliged. The test came back negative, and the doctor said apart from my ears having some fluid in them, it seemed like a normal viral infection. Since I didn\u2019t have a fever, headaches or chills, I also got my flu shot while I was there. Truthfully, I still wasn\u2019t entirely convinced by the strep test, as I recall having strep when I was younger that only showed itself in a bacteria culture a few days after I went to the doctor and had the quick strep test come back negative. I figured, as a walk in clinic, they might not have been prepared to do a bacteria culture, so I didn\u2019t say anything. I was told to come back if my ears got worse, and that was that. The next day (yesterday), I woke up and I was worse. My throat hurt again, I was awfully congested, my ears ached, and my cough was even more aggressive. I took Ibuprofen and it didn\u2019t help. I ended up canceling my plans, went back to sleep for a few hours, and when I woke up, I felt considerably better. Not good, but better. My symptoms were just less aggressive. I wasn\u2019t completely alarmed by this because I figured maybe it would just get worse before it gets better. Went about my day, and went to bed. Finally, we\u2019re at today. I wake up, and my throat felt even worse. My nose was stuffed, I was congested, my ears hurt, and I had a splitting headache. I took some Ibuprofen and went back to sleep. That was a few hours ago, and as I write this, I\u2019ve still got that splitting headache. My ears still ache. My throat doesn\u2019t hurt as bad, but it still hurts. I know I\u2019m definitively worse than I was yesterday. I won\u2019t be able to get to the clinic today, but this is still alarming for me considering my past experiences getting sick. What should I do? I can\u2019t get to the clinic, meaning my only option would be to call 911. I think that\u2019s probably a bit too drastic, but that\u2019s the only way I\u2019d be able to seek medical help until tomorrow. I\u2019m sure I can ride this out until tomorrow, but my throat looks inflamed and those white blotches are still there.

It\u2019s worth noting  I hadn\u2019t yet gotten my flu shot, but I wasn\u2019t all that concerned, as when I\u2019m in public, I keep my hands away from my face when they aren\u2019t clean, always wash my hands before I eat anything, and even open doors with my shirt covering my hand.\nI left after a few hours. The following evening, my throat was ever so slightly sore. That\u2019s a big red flag for me, but I went to bed and hoped it wasn\u2019t going to be brutal. I woke up the next morning with a hellish pain in my throat. It hurt to swallow. It hurt to drink. It hurt. Period. My ears were popping and aching as well. I went to assess the damage and noticed white blotches behind my uvula, which seemed off. After a few hours and two Ibuprofen, the throat pain was pretty minimal, though my ears were still popping. Later that evening, I developed a cough, which only got worse as the night went on. All this combined with me coughing up phlegm, I decided to go to a walk in clinic the following day if I remained this way. I woke up in the morning, and I actually felt quite a bit better. I was still coughing up phlegm, and my cough was now a constant symptom, but my throat felt pretty okay. Nonetheless, I went to the clinic that evening. I explained my symptoms, and requested a strep test, which they obliged. The test came back negative, and the doctor said apart from my ears having some fluid in them, it seemed like a normal viral infection. Since I didn\u2019t have a fever, headaches or chills, I also got my flu shot while I was there. Truthfully, I still wasn\u2019t entirely convinced by the strep test, as I recall having strep when I was younger that only showed itself in a bacteria culture a few days after I went to the doctor and had the quick strep test come back negative. I figured, as a walk in clinic, they might not have been prepared to do a bacteria culture, so I didn\u2019t say anything. I was told to come back if my ears got worse, and that was that. The next day (yesterday), I woke up and I was worse. My throat hurt again, I was awfully congested, my ears ached, and my cough was even more aggressive. I took Ibuprofen and it didn\u2019t help. I ended up canceling my plans, went back to sleep for a few hours, and when I woke up, I felt considerably better. Not good, but better. My symptoms were just less aggressive. I wasn\u2019t completely alarmed by this because I figured maybe it would just get worse before it gets better. Went about my day, and went to bed. Finally, we\u2019re at today. I wake up, and my throat felt even worse. My nose was stuffed, I was congested, my ears hurt, and I had a splitting headache. I took some Ibuprofen and went back to sleep. That was a few hours ago, and as I write this, I\u2019ve still got that splitting headache. My ears still ache. My throat doesn\u2019t hurt as bad, but it still hurts. I know I\u2019m definitively worse than I was yesterday. I won\u2019t be able to get to the clinic today, but this is still alarming for me considering my past experiences getting sick. What should I do? I can\u2019t get to the clinic, meaning my only option would be to call 911. I think that\u2019s probably a bit too drastic, but that\u2019s the only way I\u2019d be able to seek medical help until tomorrow. I\u2019m sure I can ride this out until tomorrow, but my throat looks inflamed and those white blotches are still there. Is it safe to wait until tomorrow, or should I get medical help ASAP before this potentially turns into something serious?\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this lengthy post."}

My name is Aaron, I\u2019m a 24 year old male, and I live in Canada. \n\nFor as far back as I can remember, I\u2019ve been sick what I felt has been way more often than any of my friends. I didn\u2019t realize at the time, but every single time I\u2019ve been sick (aside from maybe the odd cold?) has been the EXACT SAME symptoms - this includes a fever of typically 38.9, a very sore throat, congestion, and a cough.\n\nInitially, my mom and I believed I was constantly getting strep throat over and over again, so I would be treated as if it was and it would eventually go away.

I started to notice the pattern about 2 years ago when I first met my girlfriend. I got extremely sick like I usually do on New Years, and it lasted a couple of weeks like it usually does - but about 3 weeks later, I got sick again. Same symptoms. Fast forward to February, about a month later, I\u2019m sick again with the same symptoms. March, about a month later again - same symptoms. April, about 3 weeks later, I\u2019m sick again with the same symptoms as always.\n\nIt was around this time that my mom and I noticed that nobody ever gets sick from me. I\u2019m never, ever contagious - it almost seems like my body\u2019s reaction to something rather than an illness. \n\nThis pattern continued for about a year, up until last New Years when I got sick again. I finally had enough and I decided to go to a walk in and explain my situation. I met a doctor who finally was willing to look into what this could be, rather than just marking it off as a cold or strep throat. He gave me some forms to get bloodwork done once when I was healthy, and again when I was sick. \n\nI waited until I was sick to get my bloodwork done, but, to my surprise, I didn\u2019t get sick this year until about 9 months later. Come October, sure enough i was sick with the same symptoms as always. I got my bloodwork done while I was sick, and to my surprise all of my results came back normal EXCEPT - I had a CRP level of 49.9. I\u2019m lucky enough to be dating and living with my girlfriend who is a Registered Nurse, and she explained to me that a high CRP level indicates some sort of swelling in the body, and could really be chalked up to anything.\n\nSo, when I was healthy, I went back to get my blood work done. After getting it done, I went back into the same walk in clinic and spoke with the doctor who was willing to look into what it could be.\n\nHe explained to me that my CRP had spiked to 49.9 while I was sick, and had fallen back down to 0.77 while I was healthy. He said that usually with something like a cold or the flu, you could expect to see CRP levels of 13 or so due to a cough or a sore throat causing some swelling - but he said because it spiked to high, he thinks we could be on the right track and it could be something else.\n\nOne thing we\u2019re looking into is something called Periodic Fever Syndrome. This is usually (rarely) found in children, and typically doesn\u2019t last until adulthood. Some adults however can even more rarely be diagnosed with this.\n\nWith all of that being said, that brings me to today. I was sick about a month ago, and surprise surprise I\u2019m sick again. Last night my fever started out at around 37.9 when I noticed it, and I woke up about an hour and a half ago with a fever of 38.8 (Celsius of course). \n\nI\u2019m going to wait a few days, and when whatever this is is at its peak, I\u2019m going to get bloodwork again to see if my CRP spikes back up again.

I finally had enough and I decided to go to a walk in and explain my situation. I met a doctor who finally was willing to look into what this could be, rather than just marking it off as a cold or strep throat. He gave me some forms to get bloodwork done once when I was healthy, and again when I was sick. \n\nI waited until I was sick to get my bloodwork done, but, to my surprise, I didn\u2019t get sick this year until about 9 months later. Come October, sure enough i was sick with the same symptoms as always. I got my bloodwork done while I was sick, and to my surprise all of my results came back normal EXCEPT - I had a CRP level of 49.9. I\u2019m lucky enough to be dating and living with my girlfriend who is a Registered Nurse, and she explained to me that a high CRP level indicates some sort of swelling in the body, and could really be chalked up to anything.\n\nSo, when I was healthy, I went back to get my blood work done. After getting it done, I went back into the same walk in clinic and spoke with the doctor who was willing to look into what it could be.\n\nHe explained to me that my CRP had spiked to 49.9 while I was sick, and had fallen back down to 0.77 while I was healthy. He said that usually with something like a cold or the flu, you could expect to see CRP levels of 13 or so due to a cough or a sore throat causing some swelling - but he said because it spiked to high, he thinks we could be on the right track and it could be something else.\n\nOne thing we\u2019re looking into is something called Periodic Fever Syndrome. This is usually (rarely) found in children, and typically doesn\u2019t last until adulthood. Some adults however can even more rarely be diagnosed with this.\n\nWith all of that being said, that brings me to today. I was sick about a month ago, and surprise surprise I\u2019m sick again. Last night my fever started out at around 37.9 when I noticed it, and I woke up about an hour and a half ago with a fever of 38.8 (Celsius of course). \n\nI\u2019m going to wait a few days, and when whatever this is is at its peak, I\u2019m going to get bloodwork again to see if my CRP spikes back up again. If it does, the doctor said he will most likely try to treat it as if it\u2019s Periodic Fever Syndrome:\n\nThe reason I\u2019m writing in is to see if anyone else has something like this, or if any doctors have any opinions or insight they would be willing to share. \n\nI\u2019m so tired of being constantly sick. It\u2019s effected many jobs as I have to call in sick, it effects my day to day and general happiness, and I just want it to stop. \n\nThank you for reading all of this.\n\nDoctor Question: Do you get indigestion often?\nPatient Response: I don\u2019t get indigestion very often if really at all", "initial_info": "\"I've been experiencing worsening lower back pain over the past week that hasn't improved with home treatments.\"", "original_post": "Recurring fevers - exact same symptoms every few weeks or months, and no one ever gets sick from me. After having bloodwork done while sick, it\u2019s come to light that my CRP level spiked to 49.9, and then back down to 0.77 when I\u2019m healthy.\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the long title, I just wanted to get as much info in as I could. My name is Aaron, I\u2019m a 24 year old male, and I live in Canada. \n\nFor as far back as I can remember, I\u2019ve been sick what I felt has been way more often than any of my friends. I didn\u2019t realize at the time, but every single time I\u2019ve been sick (aside from maybe the odd cold?) has been the EXACT SAME symptoms - this includes a fever of typically 38.9, a very sore throat, congestion, and a cough.\n\nInitially, my mom and I believed I was constantly getting strep throat over and over again, so I would be treated as if it was and it would eventually go away. Like I said I don\u2019t have a ton of memory on everything back then because I didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time.\n\nThen, we come to the last few years. I started to notice the pattern about 2 years ago when I first met my girlfriend. I got extremely sick like I usually do on New Years, and it lasted a couple of weeks like it usually does - but about 3 weeks later, I got sick again. Same symptoms. Fast forward to February, about a month later, I\u2019m sick again with the same symptoms. March, about a month later again - same symptoms. April, about 3 weeks later, I\u2019m sick again with the same symptoms as always.\n\nIt was around this time that my mom and I noticed that nobody ever gets sick from me.

My (24F) boyfriend, Paul (29M), and I are fairly active. We go on road trips every year with our main stops being prime hiking spots. Paul is 5'7'' and 230 pounds. Due to his southeast asian/pacific genetics, his entire family is on the heavier side, but Paul is just as active as I am and eats well.\n\nRecently, we have gone long distance. Paul returned to live with his parents due to the pandemic while I stayed where I was. I visited him in June 2021. At this point, Paul had few symptoms, but some new minor health issues. We went hiking around Lake Tahoe and Paul was a little more out of breath than usual. He hasn't needed to use his inhaler since he was a kid, and he had to use it on this trip. We attributed this to recent wildfires in the area and poor air quality.\n\nHowever, Paul's health continued to sharply deteriorate. We went to Edinburgh, Scotland, in July. While hiking Arthur's Seat, Paul had to use his inhaler so many times he emptied it out. He could not get it refilled as we were out of the country. Until the end of the trip, Paul's breathing became more and more labored and he developed a persistent cough.\n\nI did not visit Paul August-November 2021. We spoke on the phone and Skyped regularly. During this time, Paul would sometimes leave the call or mute for a few minutes. He'd come back and apologize, saying he'd had to cough pretty violently and didn't want me to hear. I was concerned. I overheard one wracking, moaning coughing session and knew it was not just asthma or an irritated throat. By October 2021, the air quality in his area had greatly improved.\n\nI persuaded Paul to visit his general practitioner. His GP dismissed all of his concerns and cited Paul's being fat and asthmatic as the source of his issues, and that the issues would disappear with rest and exercise. I had to fight doctors for years to get them to take my chronic pelvic pain seriously, and was finally diagnosed with an ovarian cyst that was 8mm long and about to burst, so I have experience with self advocacy in the medical space. I helped Paul see new doctors.\n\nIn mid-October 2021, Paul developed abdominal edema. Paul's feet, legs, and lower stomach were swelling up like crazy. He gained 40 pounds. He could barely move at all, even to go to the bathroom. He couldn't sleep lying down without suffocating, which only worsened his exhaustion. He went to the doctor again and was prescribed diuretics. The diuretics helped with the swelling and extra weight and within 2 weeks he was back to his regular weight, but the coughing and weakness persisted.\n\nAbout a month after regularly taking diuretics (November), Paul started feeling intense nausea on a weekly basis. This nausea would prompt coughing fits. Paul couldn't eat or focus while nauseated. Our calls became more and more infrequent as Paul's nausea and headaches grew. He told me sometimes the nausea would get so bad that he would vomit. There were no patterns to the vomiting--it didn't happen at a certain time of day or after meals. Sometimes it was foamy. He got a CT scan to look at his gall bladder and all results were within normal ranges. Blood tests, including labs for liver function, all came back normal. His doctor referred him to a gastroenterologist for more testing, but due to increases in COVID-19 cases, they haven't even processed his file, let alone scheduled appointments, which would be months out. A nurse anticipated he wouldn't be able to go in until February 2022, but at his rate of decline, this has me concerned for his mental wellbeing and life quality.\n\nThis week, in late December 2021, I visited him and his family for Christmas. I had heard from Paul about his issues and was following closely with his medical updates, but seeing it firsthand was another thing altogether. I have never seen human suffering and sickness like this up close or cared for another human being in such an intimate way.\n\nEvery single day, he has intense coughing fits and bouts of nausea where he makes vocalizations and gags, usually every few hours. At least once a day, these coughing fits are so bad that he spends 5-30 minutes vomiting in the sink. The vomiting has increased drastically. After this, the nausea alleviates, but Paul feels exhausted and has migraines. He barely eats. He barely sleeps.\n\nToday, he had three different nausea/coughing bouts that induced vomiting. One developed rapidly and he threw up in a restaurant bathroom. The last one, which just happened this evening as of writing this post, also caught him by surprise, and he vomited in the kitchen sink. The vomiting was so physically taxing that his nose bled profusely and he lost control of his bowels and peed himself. He was not strong enough to make it down the hall to the bathroom. Eventually, I assisted him into the shower. I am writing this before bed, and he is still coughing, and has a migraine. He hasn't gotten up from where he sat after taking the shower.\n\nI would appreciate any medical advice about what might be causing what Paul is going through, as well as tips for how to navigate the medical system to ensure this gets treated in the best way possible. I would like to reiterate that while neither of us are marathon running body builders, Paul (before all of this) was physically active and monitored his eating habits. He was also mentally active and had returned to school to pursue a degree in a new field. We both have families that are reasonably well off and are good support systems.\n\nPaul is one tough puppy, and reassures me that it \"isn't so bad,\" but after seeing it firsthand, I know this is not something that can continue the way it is. I am extremely worried, and caring for him is beginning to wear on me mentally. Sometimes I feel sympathy nausea when I hear the noises he makes in the bathroom.\n\nPlease help in any way possible. I appreciate any and every tip, and can provide additional information if needed. Thank you very much.\n\nUPDATE 12/26:\n\nWe went to the ER at 4 AM right after Christmas. Luckily, it was almost completely empty. I was not allowed to go back with him, so for the entire five hours I was sitting in the waiting room, I was only ever accompanied by one or two other people at a time.\n\nPaul's shortness of breath, fatigue, and wracking coughs got him seen quickly. He texted me updates as things progressed. He got every test I wrote down from these comments--BNP test, pulmonary work, chest x rays, GI work. An echocardigram is scheduled for next week.\n\nThey found out right away that Paul's BNP results were seven times higher than usual. They said this was indicative of heart failure. They also tested Paul for COVID 19. He tested negative, but did test indicating he had some kind of viral illness.\n\nPaul's doctor concluded that he was suffering from chronic RSV that was made worse by poor genetics, asthma, and obesity. Paul did confirm he had what felt like a respiratory illness in Scotland in June, then after going to a wedding in October, then this week when he got severely ill and we found out his mother had a cold.\n\nThere is no cure for RSV, but a vaccine has reached human trials. The only things Paul can do to alleviate his own suffering and avoid a heart attack is to make significant lifestyle changes and live like an immunocompromised person. I believe in his ability to achieve the former, but the latter is more difficult because of his emotionally overattached mother who brings the entire extended family out for lunches, movie nights, shopping, etc. several times a week. I'm concerned she won't take it seriously or will be in denial to avoid feeling responsible and will therefore continue to expose Paul to colds that could kill him.\n\nPaul is currently resting. He was given medication for his nausea and a new inhaler. He is doing better but still coughing. We have already started on his new food regimen. I am hoping for the best, but the pandemic has proved that people rarely take precautions for others' goodwill. Thank you for all your support.

My (24F) boyfriend, Paul (29M), and I are fairly active. We go on road trips every year with our main stops being prime hiking spots. Paul is 5'7'' and 230 pounds. Due to his southeast asian/pacific genetics, his entire family is on the heavier side, but Paul is just as active as I am and eats well.\n\nRecently, we have gone long distance. Paul returned to live with his parents due to the pandemic while I stayed where I was. I visited him in June 2021. At this point, Paul had few symptoms, but some new minor health issues. We went hiking around Lake Tahoe and Paul was a little more out of breath than usual. He hasn't needed to use his inhaler since he was a kid, and he had to use it on this trip. We attributed this to recent wildfires in the area and poor air quality.\n\nHowever, Paul's health continued to sharply deteriorate. We went to Edinburgh, Scotland, in July. While hiking Arthur's Seat, Paul had to use his inhaler so many times he emptied it out. He could not get it refilled as we were out of the country. Until the end of the trip, Paul's breathing became more and more labored and he developed a persistent cough.\n\nI did not visit Paul August-November 2021. We spoke on the phone and Skyped regularly. During this time, Paul would sometimes leave the call or mute for a few minutes. He'd come back and apologize, saying he'd had to cough pretty violently and didn't want me to hear. I was concerned. I overheard one wracking, moaning coughing session and knew it was not just asthma or an irritated throat. By October 2021, the air quality in his area had greatly improved.\n\nI persuaded Paul to visit his general practitioner. His GP dismissed all of his concerns and cited Paul's being fat and asthmatic as the source of his issues, and that the issues would disappear with rest and exercise. I had to fight doctors for years to get them to take my chronic pelvic pain seriously, and was finally diagnosed with an ovarian cyst that was 8mm long and about to burst, so I have experience with self advocacy in the medical space. I helped Paul see new doctors.\n\nIn mid-October 2021, Paul developed abdominal edema. Paul's feet, legs, and lower stomach were swelling up like crazy. He gained 40 pounds. He could barely move at all, even to go to the bathroom. He couldn't sleep lying down without suffocating, which only worsened his exhaustion. He went to the doctor again and was prescribed diuretics. The diuretics helped with the swelling and extra weight and within 2 weeks he was back to his regular weight, but the coughing and weakness persisted.\n\nAbout a month after regularly taking diuretics (November), Paul started feeling intense nausea on a weekly basis. This nausea would prompt coughing fits. Paul couldn't eat or focus while nauseated. Our calls became more and more infrequent as Paul's nausea and headaches grew. He told me sometimes the nausea would get so bad that he would vomit. There were no patterns to the vomiting--it didn't happen at a certain time of day or after meals. Sometimes it was foamy. He got a CT scan to look at his gall bladder and all results were within normal ranges. Blood tests, including labs for liver function, all came back normal. His doctor referred him to a gastroenterologist for more testing, but due to increases in COVID-19 cases, they haven't even processed his file, let alone scheduled appointments, which would be months out. A nurse anticipated he wouldn't be able to go in until February 2022, but at his rate of decline, this has me concerned for his mental wellbeing and life quality.\n\nThis week, in late December 2021, I visited him and his family for Christmas. I had heard from Paul about his issues and was following closely with his medical updates, but seeing it firsthand was another thing altogether. I have never seen human suffering and sickness like this up close or cared for another human being in such an intimate way.\n\nEvery single day, he has intense coughing fits and bouts of nausea where he makes vocalizations and gags, usually every few hours. At least once a day, these coughing fits are so bad that he spends 5-30 minutes vomiting in the sink. The vomiting has increased drastically. After this, the nausea alleviates, but Paul feels exhausted and has migraines. He barely eats. He barely sleeps.\n\nToday, he had three different nausea/coughing bouts that induced vomiting. One developed rapidly and he threw up in a restaurant bathroom. The last one, which just happened this evening as of writing this post, also caught him by surprise, and he vomited in the kitchen sink. The vomiting was so physically taxing that his nose bled profusely and he lost control of his bowels and peed himself. He was not strong enough to make it down the hall to the bathroom. Eventually, I assisted him into the shower. I am writing this before bed, and he is still coughing, and has a migraine. He hasn't gotten up from where he sat after taking the shower.\n\nI would appreciate any medical advice about what might be causing what Paul is going through, as well as tips for how to navigate the medical system to ensure this gets treated in the best way possible. I would like to reiterate that while neither of us are marathon running body builders, Paul (before all of this) was physically active and monitored his eating habits. He was also mentally active and had returned to school to pursue a degree in a new field. We both have families that are reasonably well off and are good support systems.\n\nPaul is one tough puppy, and reassures me that it \"isn't so bad,\" but after seeing it firsthand, I know this is not something that can continue the way it is. I am extremely worried, and caring for him is beginning to wear on me mentally. Sometimes I feel sympathy nausea when I hear the noises he makes in the bathroom.\n\nPlease help in any way possible. I appreciate any and every tip, and can provide additional information if needed. Thank you very much.\n\nUPDATE 12/26:\n\nWe went to the ER at 4 AM right after Christmas. Luckily, it was almost completely empty. I was not allowed to go back with him, so for the entire five hours I was sitting in the waiting room, I was only ever accompanied by one or two other people at a time.\n\nPaul's shortness of breath, fatigue, and wracking coughs got him seen quickly. He texted me updates as things progressed. He got every test I wrote down from these comments--BNP test, pulmonary work, chest x rays, GI work. An echocardigram is scheduled for next week.\n\nThey found out right away that Paul's BNP results were seven times higher than usual. They said this was indicative of heart failure. They also tested Paul for COVID 19. He tested negative, but did test indicating he had some kind of viral illness.\n\nPaul's doctor concluded that he was suffering from chronic RSV that was made worse by poor genetics, asthma, and obesity. Paul did confirm he had what felt like a respiratory illness in Scotland in June, then after going to a wedding in October, then this week when he got severely ill and we found out his mother had a cold.\n\nThere is no cure for RSV, but a vaccine has reached human trials. The only things Paul can do to alleviate his own suffering and avoid a heart attack is to make significant lifestyle changes and live like an immunocompromised person. I believe in his ability to achieve the former, but the latter is more difficult because of his emotionally overattached mother who brings the entire extended family out for lunches, movie nights, shopping, etc. several times a week. I'm concerned she won't take it seriously or will be in denial to avoid feeling responsible and will therefore continue to expose Paul to colds that could kill him.\n\nPaul is currently resting. He was given medication for his nausea and a new inhaler. He is doing better but still coughing. We have already started on his new food regimen. I am hoping for the best, but the pandemic has proved that people rarely take precautions for others' goodwill. Thank you for all your support.

He didn\u2019t tell me i have pulmonary fibrosis specifically he said i have ILD but i knew thats a broad term so im guessing its pulmonary fibrosis based on the fact that my hrct scan report said fibrosis in lungs and bilateral lungs.

The hot tub is well maintained and kept to the correct levels of chlorine, pH, etc. I also have a small fissure on my anus due to prior constipation. Do I have cause to be concerned?\n\nAnother issue is that I asked him to get me a beer whilst he was out (I normally drink this beer with lime) and when he gave it to me I was already a bit anxious due to the parts aforementioned. I tried it and it tasted off, but when I gave it to my friends they smelled it and it smelled fine, but one of my friends thought it tasted odd such as it had lemonade in it or something. I took two sips in total from the drink but I didn't swallow it, instead spitting it out and throwing the drink out. \n\nIt smelled fine but tasted a bit off. My friends don't think that the mentioned friend would be the type to mess with a drink, and he promised me that he didn't do anything to it. Am I worrying about something for no reason? Or should I be concerned? Do I need to be tested for the HIV virus? Or am I just being overly anxious? \n\nHe has been a best friend of mine for a long time, and I often worry about this. This is the first time that I have mentioned it however to anyone. \n\nDo I need to be tested or anything? I don't know what I'm worried about him having done to my drink. Maybe urinated in it or something, but again, I think this is down to me just being anxious or silly - certainly if he did do anything to it, it would smell off, too? \n\nDoctor Question: Also, do you really think he'd do that?\nPatient Response: Thank you. And no, I don't really think he would do that. I suppose it's just my nervousness and anxiety.", "atomic_facts": ["- The patient is 19 years old.", "- The patient identifies as a boy.", "- The patient has a friend who has HIV.", "- The patient and the friend have hugged on numerous occasions.", "- The patient and the friend have shared a drink on numerous occasions.", "- The patient and the friend have shared a cigarette on numerous occasions.", "- The patient and the friend have shared a hot tub.", "- The patient states that there has been nothing sexual between him and the friend.", "- The patient is worried about the possibility of HIV infection.", "- The patient was in the hot tub with the friend and other friends on the night in question.", "- The patient has a small spot on his chest that was popped.", "- The patient now has a small cut on his chest from popping that spot.", "- The patient notes that the hot tub is well maintained with correct chlorine and pH levels.", "- The patient has a small fissure on his anus due to prior constipation.", "- The patient wonders if these factors (cut, fissure, shared hot tub) pose any risk of HIV transmission.", "- The patient asked the friend to get him a beer.", "- The patient usually drinks this type of beer with lime.", "- The patient tasted the beer and found it tasted off.", "- Other friends smelled the beer and said it smelled fine.", "- One friend mentioned that the beer tasted like it might have lemonade in it.", "- The patient took two sips of the beer in total.", "- The patient did not swallow the beer but spat it out.", "- The patient threw the beer away.", "- The patient\u2019s friends do not believe the friend would tamper with the drink.", "- The friend promised he did not do anything to the beer.", "- The patient feels anxious that something could have been done to the drink.", "- The patient worries the friend might have urinated in the beer.", "- The patient thinks that if the friend had done something, the drink would likely smell off, too.", "- The patient questions whether he is worrying for no reason.", "- The patient wonders if he needs to get tested for HIV.", "- The patient wonders if he is being overly anxious.", "- The patient has been close friends with this individual for a long time.", "- The patient says this is the first time he has mentioned these worries to anyone.", "- The patient asks if he should be tested or if his concerns are due to anxiety.", "- The doctor asks whether the patient truly thinks the friend would do such a thing.", "- The patient responds that he does not really believe the friend would do that.", "- The patient believes his worries stem from nervousness and anxiety."], "usage": {"input_tokens": 588, "prompt_tokens": 3581, "reasoning_tokens": 3008}}

Evidence to this could be that when this became an issue in the spring, I did ask one of my parents to smell for my SO's breath on a visit. They reported nothing, but during the visit the breath had faded nearly completely. This is also true for the aforementioned trip to the dentist. \n\nTL;DR: SO's breath smells so bad I can't be in the same room with them. SO cannot smell it, their friends say they can't smell it, and any time I try to get a neutral third party to detect it, it goes away to a level that's not going to be smelled by someone who isn't in kissing proximity.\n\nWhat could this be? And what doctor should we go to?\n\nUPDATE: I've now confirmed this appears to be stress related as we have been on vacation for a while now, away from work, and the smell is GONE.

After doing that, I accidentally dropped it and it broke on the tile floor. None of it got on me, and I spent the next 30-40 minutes cleaning it up (wearing latex gloves and avoiding any contact with the mercury if possible, mostly used ziploc bags and tissue paper, though I think some of it did touch my hands a couple times, after which I washed my hands with hot water and a ton of soap for about 3 to 4 minutes, about three times, don't have any rashes or anything on my hands). \n\nAfter I was done, I put all the things I used to clean up with on a small plastic bag and I put that in a larger trash bag, took it out and threw it in the landfill tub outside my apartment. After I got back, I noticed some tiny droplets were caught between the tiles, deep enough that I couldn't move them with anything I had.

After doing that, I accidentally dropped it and it broke on the tile floor. None of it got on me, and I spent the next 30-40 minutes cleaning it up (wearing latex gloves and avoiding any contact with the mercury if possible, mostly used ziploc bags and tissue paper, though I think some of it did touch my hands a couple times, after which I washed my hands with hot water and a ton of soap for about 3 to 4 minutes, about three times, don't have any rashes or anything on my hands). \n\nAfter I was done, I put all the things I used to clean up with on a small plastic bag and I put that in a larger trash bag, took it out and threw it in the landfill tub outside my apartment.

I mean maybe if something else is punctured or bleeding, then I'd actually be dead by now from internal bleeding, but still, how can this hurt so much without something being broken?\n\nDoctor Question: If you're genuinely concerned and would like an x-ray you could always go back and ask them for one, I'm not sure how health care works in Sweden though so sorry if I'm wrong\nPatient Response: None\n\nDoctor Question: If not, or if there is intense pain that remains along the spine, I would definitely go to see someone.\nPatient Response: None", "atomic_facts": ["- The patient is 29 years old.", "- The patient\u2019s height is 170 cm.", "- The patient\u2019s height is 5'7\".", "- The patient\u2019s weight is 75 kilograms.", "- The patient\u2019s weight is 165 pounds.", "- The patient is male.", "- The patient smokes weed once a week.", "- The patient uses a dry vape pen to smoke.", "- The patient smokes about 0.1 gram of weed each time.", "- The patient rarely drinks alcohol (one or two drinks once a month).", "- The patient experiences headaches likely related to changes in air pressure.", "- The patient usually takes 500 mg of paracetamol for headaches.", "- The patient also sleeps or takes a hot shower to relieve headaches.", "- The patient has a quadcuspid aortic valve (heart defect).", "- The patient\u2019s quadcuspid aortic valve is otherwise healthy.", "- The patient needs follow-up for the heart valve once every 1\u20132 years.", "- The patient went snowboarding on a Monday.", "- The patient fell on snow with the chest as the main point of impact.", "- The patient has severe chest pain since the fall.", "- The patient finds it painful to breathe deeply.", "- The patient finds it painful to laugh.", "- The patient finds it painful to move the upper body.", "- The patient describes the pain as worse than being kicked in the groin.", "- The pain slightly improves throughout the day.", "- The pain returns strongly after sleeping at night.", "- The pain is extreme when getting out of bed in the morning.", "- The patient notices no visible signs of injury on the chest.", "- The patient visited an emergency center (n\u00e4rakute) in Sweden.", "- The doctor listened to the patient\u2019s breathing.", "- The doctor checked for a punctured lung.", "- The doctor prescribed an anti-inflammatory medication taken twice a day with food.", "- The doctor wrote \u201cContusion on the chest\u201d in the patient\u2019s records.", "- The patient is concerned about the need for an X-ray.", "- The patient worries something might be broken or there could be internal bleeding.", "- The patient is unsure how to request an X-ray in Sweden\u2019s healthcare system.", "- The patient is experiencing intense pain that makes movement difficult.", "- The patient is paranoid and seeks a second opinion.", "- The doctor suggested returning to request an X-ray if concerned.", "- The doctor suggested seeing someone if there is intense pain along the spine.", "- The patient has not yet responded to the doctor\u2019s suggestion."], "usage": {"input_tokens": 684, "prompt_tokens": 2153, "reasoning_tokens": 1600}}
