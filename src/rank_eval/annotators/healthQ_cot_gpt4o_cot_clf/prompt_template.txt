I want you to assess the quality of clinical questions asked during a medical consultation. You will be given a conversation log of a doctor-patient interaction, along with two candidate doctor follow-up questions generated by different models that will come next in the conversation. Your task is to rank these questions based on which would be preferred by human clinicians for effective communication and patient care. The purpose of the follow-up doctor questions is to elicit additional information to help the clinician make a more informed diagnostic decision. 

Evaluation Task
I will provide the conversation log and two candidate clinical questions. Your task is to rank the questions based on the criteria above, ensuring that the question ranked 1st aligns best with effective clinical communication.

## Conversation Log (Context)

"""{instruction}"""

## Model Outputs

Here are the unordered follow-up questions generated by the models. Each output is associated with a specific model, identified by a unique model identifier.

{{
    {{
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }}
}}

## Task

Before you respond, think carefully about what are the important features and characteristics of effective clinical questions to optimize both efficiency and quality of the clinical interaction. Please ensure that the ranking reflects what the majority of human clinicians would prefer in a real-world medical setting. Answer by first providing a concise one-sentence explanation of why one question is better than the other, and then end your answer by providing the model identifier of the best output. We will use the last character of your output `output[-1]` as the name of the best model, so make sure you finish with the token of the model identifiers and nothing else: `m` or `M` (no quotes, no dots, no backticks, no new lines, ...). For example:

### Concise explanation
some explanation.

### Which is best, m or M?
M/m

Now is your turn.

## Your answer: "Concise explanation" followed by "Which is best, m or M?"
